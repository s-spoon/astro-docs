This guide outlines the key features of Aptean Business Intelligence for M2M. It allows you to quickly generate and analyze various reports using the product. 

Aptean BI integrates with Microsoft Power BI to provide business analytics tools that deliver insights across your organization. This solution includes templates that help you transform critical business data into meaningful real-time visualizations, enabling your team to make informed business decisions. Each template comes with multiple pages of visuals that can be filtered and customized to suit your reporting needs. Once you have saved a template, you can publish one or more dashboards or reports to the Power BI Web app, where you can share, review, and filter the visuals.
