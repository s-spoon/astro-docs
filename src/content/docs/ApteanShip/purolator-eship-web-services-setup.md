## Request a Production Key


To use Purolator E-Ship Web Services, you must request a Production Key. The Production Key gives you account-specific shipping, tracking, estimates, and pickups information.

Once your request is verified, your Production Key will be activated by Purolator. You will need the Production API Key and Password that are provided to you to complete the setup process.

2. Click on the **Carrier Accounts** menu item.
3. Under **Add Carrier Account**, select **Purolator**.
4. Enter the account information. When you are done, click **Add**.
	* Reference: If you use multiple carrier accounts for EasyPost, you can more easily identify them in Aptean Ship by populating the Reference field in your EasyPost Dashboard. For example, instead of a long account number, you can display a location name or other identifying term.
