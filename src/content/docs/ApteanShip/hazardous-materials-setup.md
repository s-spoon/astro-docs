To streamline your HazMat/DG shipping process, use the following setup articles to set up all the required elements before you start shipping.
### 1. Hazardous Materials Profiles


Create predefined Hazardous Materials profiles that contain all the data needed to identify Hazardous Materials tendered for shipping, and can be assigned at various levels of the shipment.

>[!Tip] Learn about creating and assigning [Hazardous Materials Profiles](hazardous-materials-profiles.md).
### 2. Hazardous Materials Preferences


Set up the contact information needed when shipping HazMat/DG. There's also an option to allow Aptean Ship to populate Hazardous Materials detail based on line items.

>[!Tip] See [Hazardous Materials Preferences](hazardous-materials-preferences.md) for more detailed information.
### 3. Hazardous Materials/Dangerous Goods Documents


Aptean Ship supports hazardous freight and parcel shipments for all carriers except DHL, USPS, and OnTrac. You will need to enable certain shipping documents based on the carrier you are shipping with, which you can set up in [Printing Profiles](printing-profiles.md). It is your responsibility as the shipper to ensure that your shipments have the appropriate documentation and that all forms are accurate and complete.

#### UPS
For each hazardous materials package, UPS requires shippers to affix an authorized UPS Shipping Paper or Shipper's Declaration (for IATA shipments, three copies of the DG Dec are required) to each package, and to complete an entry in the UPS Shipper's Certification of Hazardous Materials (end of day manifest for hazardous materials). Each UPS driver receiving hazardous materials must also receive a hard copy of the Shipper's Certification representing those hazardous materials shipments.

Aptean Ship can generate the UPS Hazardous Materials Manifest, Shipping Declaration for Hazardous Materials/Dangerous Goods, and HazMat Shipping Papers.

#### FedEx

Aptean Ship can generate shipping forms OP-900, the FedEx HazMat Certificate, and Declaration of Dangerous Goods.

#### LTL

Aptean Ship can print the HazMat Bill of Lading.
