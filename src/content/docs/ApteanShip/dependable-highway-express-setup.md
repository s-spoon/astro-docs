Aptean Ship directly integrates with Dependable Highway Express (DHE) to provide rating and tracking via the Internet for LTL shipments to the USA (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Aptean Ship prints the BOL, package, and pallet labels, which you can set up under [Printing Profiles](printing-profiles.md).

You will need your Dependable "Customer Code" during this setup, so have that number handy. The Customer Code is your account number. If you do not know this number, please call DHE Customer Service at (800) 548.8608 x4950 or inquire by email at DHECustomerservice@godependable.com.
