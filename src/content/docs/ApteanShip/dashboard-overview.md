Views are the overall configuration of widgets, their position, size, and state. Users can save Views in order to quickly restore a specific workspace setup. Saved Views can also be shared among users.
### First Time Login


The first time you log in to the Dashboard, you'll receive a prompt asking if you want to install the default Views. These default Views are widget combinations commonly used by Aptean Ship users. You can add to them or change them once installed. If you choose to use the default Views, they are loaded onto the screen.

If you choose not to install the default Views, you will start off with a default blank page named View1, which can be renamed to whatever name you like. Then you would add the table, chart or map widgets that you want to use for this View.
