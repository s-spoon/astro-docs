The Shipment Import tool offers enhanced flexibility in the handling of shipment data and batches. Shipments can be imported and processed as a batch, including package contents information, generating all of the shipment labels and documents at once.

You can save import settings as a named template, and maintain multiple templates that may be exported and distributed. You can also set up the import template to automatically put line items into packages/handling units.

>[!Note] When processing batches, the configuration settings of the client for the current user will be applied to the imported shipments. Settings regarding address validation, auto-packing, storing line item information, etc., will all have a direct effect on the shipments, in the same way as orders being imported from a source interface. 

This section includes information about setting up templates that control shipment import, instructions for the Shipment Import wizard, and how to import shipments and batches. 

These are the steps to get started :

* Set up the import template.

* Review and name the template.

* Map input columns to Aptean Ship shipment fields.

* Configure template settings.

* After your template is set up, you can Import Shipments

* Update the template Source File

* Import/Export All Templates

* Manage Imported Batches


We have additionally provided examples to illustrate both a simple import template setup and a more complex template that packages line items.

**Import Template Setup**

The first step in setting up Shipment Import is to import a file containing shipment data and use that data to create an Import Template.

**Import File**

From the Tools menu in Aptean Ship, select Shipment Import.
Click the Add New Shipment Import Template button.
