The Main page has two general DHL settings that you can configure. This page also contains display-only information about DHL supported billing types and options. These settings apply to all of your enabled DHL accounts. To access this page, go to Setup > Carrier Interfaces > DHL and click on the Main heading.
## Configuration


### Disable use of DHL


Check this option if you do not want DHL to be available for rating or shipping. DHL will not appear in the Carrier field on the Shipment tab.
### Enable background tracking


Background tracking collects shipment data so that you can look up delivery information for past shipments and generate late deliveries reports from the Aptean Ship Dashboard.
## Supported Carriers


DHL is the only supported carrier on this tab. Entries cannot be added or deleted. Expand the DHL row to show supported Services.
## Supported Billing Types


This section displays the supported billing types available for DHL – Prepaid (Sender), Recipient, and Third Party – and a description of each.
## Supported Options


This section displays a list of the Package and Shipment options that DHL supports, and a description for each one.

## DHL Settings
Reference fields allow the recipient to track incoming packages using a reference field such as the PO#. Aptean Ship supports two reference fields at the shipment level: Shipper Reference and Receiver Reference. The reference fields print on the DHL shipping label when you process a shipment.

Specify the shipment field to include as a reference field by selecting it from the drop-down list.
