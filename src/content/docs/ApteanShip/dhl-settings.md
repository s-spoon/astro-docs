Reference fields allow the recipient to track incoming packages using a reference field such as the PO#. Aptean Ship supports two reference fields at the shipment level: Shipper Reference and Receiver Reference. The reference fields print on the DHL shipping label when you process a shipment.

Specify the shipment field to include as a reference field by selecting it from the drop-down list.
