Aptean Ship supports shipping small parcel domestic and international packages with UPS. Our next generation UPS module uses the latest web service technology to eliminate end-of-day PLD uploads, give you access to Mail Innovations, SurePost and more. Shipments are rated and relayed to UPS in real-time via the Internet, and labels/documents are returned and printed by Aptean Ship.
