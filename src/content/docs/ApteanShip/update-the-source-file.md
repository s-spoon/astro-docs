The source file is the import file you selected [in the first step](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/import-template-setup/) as the source to create the Import Template.

To use a different import file with a template, you can update the source selection on the Shipment Import Setup dialog. 

> [!TIP] "To access this dialog, click **Rate/Ship** on the toolbar, select **Shipments** from the menu, and click the **Import** button." 

Click the **Update** button to change the source file being used, without having to modify the template’s configuration, provided that the new file adheres to the existing definition.
