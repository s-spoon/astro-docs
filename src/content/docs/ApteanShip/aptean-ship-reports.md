### Address Correction Notes


The Address Correction report allows you to generate a shipment report for 4 types of Address Validation results.
* Corrected: Ship To Addresses that were found to be invalid and were corrected.
* Invalid: Ship To Addresses that were found to be invalid and were not corrected.
* Not Validated: In this case, Address Validation is turned off, and these addresses have not been tested for validity.
* Valid: Ship To Addresses that were checked and found to be correct.


You can select the type of result for which to generate a report from the Recipient Validation Status filter.

### Variations

After selecting a report, you may want to add filters and change the Sort By field to generate a distinct alteration of this report. If you want to run this report again in the future, you can save these parameters as a Variation. For example, Aptean Ship Reports comes with a Daily Shipments report that will generate a shipment report for the current day. You can add a filter for Ship Carrier Name if you want to generate a Daily Shipments report for a specific carrier. So let's say we want to generate a report for USPS only; we would add "Ship Carrier Name equals 'USPS'" and then save these parameters as a Variation.

You'll be prompted to type in a new name for the Variation.

Once you save a Variation, it will be available for future use. The next time you select this report, you can click the Variation field drop-down list and select the report you want.
