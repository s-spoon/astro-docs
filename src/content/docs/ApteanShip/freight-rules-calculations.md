Aptean Ship gives you the option to create calculations when adding freight rules so that you can set the charges to the result of a calculation. You can define a calculation once and save it so that you can reuse the same calculation and select it for a different freight rule. Saved calculations are available in a drop-down list.

Calculations can be created for the Min/Max, Increase, Decrease, and Calculation types of freight rules.
## New Calculation


1. From within the freight rules wizard, choose the calculation option and click **New**.
2. Type in a Calculation Name or accept the default name.
3. Next, create the calculation. You can add an Aptean Ship field, Calculation (previously created) or Constant Value.
4. Continue to build the calculation by adding an operator (multiply, divide, add, or subtract the values) and a second Aptean Ship field, Calculation or Constant Value. As you add elements, the expanded calculation displays in the bottom pane.
