Aptean Ship provides you with a variety of customizable reports that users can view, edit, and generate. You can also create new reports, print reports to a PDF, or export them to a file.
### Report Designer


The Report Designer allows you to edit or create new reports. You can access the Report Designer by clicking Setup in the top navigation bar and then selecting Report Designer from the side menu.

### Existing Reports


Aptean Ship comes stocked with useful reports that you can use as they are or edit in the Report Designer. Clicking the pencil icon in a report's row will launch a window where you can change or add to the parameters that will define the report.

### Report Elements


Although Aptean Ship provides you with more than a dozen commonly used reports, you can also create a completely new report based on your own criteria and parameters. For more information about the different components of reports and creating new reports, see [Elements of a Report](elements-of-a-report.md).
### Reports in the Dashboard


All of the reports in the Report Designer can be accessed from [Dashboard > Reports](aptean-ship-reports.md).

After selecting a report, users can:
* change filters and other parameters and save them as Variations for the report. These Variations are saved under a name of the user's choosing for future use.
* generate reports and print them or save them to a file.
