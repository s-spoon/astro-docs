5. Click the Web Service Request button. This will generate a Security Token ID for Aptean Ship to use when transmitting shipment information to AAA Cooper. The Security Token ID will be sent via email to the email address registered for the account. The Token ID is required when setting up your AAA Cooper account in Aptean Ship.
