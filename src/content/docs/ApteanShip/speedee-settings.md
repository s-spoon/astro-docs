Reference fields allow the recipient to track incoming packages using a reference field (such as the PO#) along with the ship date or your shipper number, or other information that may not normally appear in the package details. Aptean Ship supports 2 Reference fields at the package level.

Specify the shipment fields to include as reference fields by selecting them from the drop-down lists. You can select from the default list, or select Advanced... to choose from a list of fields. You can also choose the data source from which fields are displayed. Use the magnifying glass if you want to search shipment fields using a search filter. The Label Tag column allows you to change the default tag on the label to a label of your choosing.
