### Default Prepaid Billing Type

This is the default Billing Type for shipments that are paid for by the shipper.

These settings affect the options available under Billing on the Shipment.

Check to disable this carrier. Once disabled, you will not be able to rate or ship using this carrier when shipping with Worldwide Express. You will not see rates for this carrier when you rate a shipment, nor will this carrier appear on the Shipment when Bill Freight Type is set to Sender. The carrier will still be available when Bill Freight Type is set to Recipient.
