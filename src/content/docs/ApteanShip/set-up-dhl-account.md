4. For Settings, check the first option if your company is AES4 Approved so that you can file the EEI post-departure. This must be enabled in order for that option to appear in the International tab when processing International shipments.

5. The second Settings option, "My account is registered for paperless trade shipments with DHL", applies to customers who are registered for paperless trade. Paperless trade allows you to electronically transmit documents like the Commercial Invoice or Certificate of Origin to Customs, eliminating the need to print and manually attach them to shipments. When this setting is checked, the DHL Paperless Invoice option becomes available in when shipping.

6. Click Finish.
