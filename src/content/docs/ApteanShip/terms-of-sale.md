The CFR term requires the seller to clear the goods for export.

### CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight)

The seller has the same obligations as under the CFR but also has to procure marine insurance against the buyer's risk of loss or damage to the goods during the carriage.

The CPT term requires the seller to clear the goods for export.
