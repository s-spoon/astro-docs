## Shipping Notes


### How to ship with Consolidators


Consolidators will appear as carriers in the Carrier drop-down list in the Shipment Editor. Select the Consolidator and service, and process the shipment as you normally would.


### DHL


EasyPost only returns the manifest form for domestic shipments (DHL eCommerce). For international shipments, the DHL Global Mail International Manifest info is transmitted to DHL on End of Day but the manifest must be printed from your DHL Web Portal. If you are shipping domestic and international, you must give the driver the manifest forms for both.
### Insurance


To use insurance with your EasyPost shipments, you can only select EasyPost Insurance in the Package or Shipment options. EasyPost Insurance outline:
* Enter the value of the contents.
* EasyPost charges 1% of the value with a $1 minimum.
* EasyPost handles all claims, which are paid out within 30 days.


### Insurance Settings


Apply to:


* Divide Between Packages: The Base Amount that you enter is divided equally among all packages in the shipment. The Base Amount will equal the Total Amount.
* Process By Package: The insurance amount is applied on a package by package basis, and the Base Amount will be set up for individual packages on the Packaging tab under Package Options. Aptean Ship may automatically calculate insurance based on the value of items packed into a box or packaging unit. Aptean Ship only calculates the insurance when items are first packed; insurance will not be recalculated if items are moved or deleted from packaging. You can manually override any calculated values.
* Each Package: The Base Amount is applied to the insurance amount for each package in the shipment. Therefore, the Total Amount will equal the Base Amount  multiplied by the number of packages in the shipment
