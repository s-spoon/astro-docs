Spee-Dee 2 stands for the **NEW Spee-Dee API**. The setup and shipping work similarly to Spee-Dee, but rating, shipping, and getting manifest are all done via the new Spee-Dee API. It still provides small parcel shipments to Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, and the St. Louis metro area, as well as select cities and ZIP Codes in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Nebraska. 

You must set up at least one account to ship with Spee-Dee 2. The account can be the same as Spee-Dee.

## Steps to Set Up a Spee-Dee 2 Account

1. From the **Aptean Ship** Ship screen, select **Setup > Carrier Interfaces > Spee-Dee 2**.
2. Click the **Accounts** heading and select **New Account**.
