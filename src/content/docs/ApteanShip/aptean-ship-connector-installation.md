### Where to Install the Connector

Your printer configuration and scale locations can define where you want to install the Aptean Ship Connector.

### Printer configuration

Isolated Printers (most common): Install the Connector on each machine if the printers are isolated and not shared from a central server.

Shared Printers: To centralize the Connector and minimize the number of Connectors you have to maintain, you can install the Connector on one machine to act as a print server. This works if the printers are shared and the Connector Service login user has access rights to see and print to all printers.

### Scales

If using scales, a Connector must be installed on each machine with scales attached.

### Installation


The next step is to run the .EXE file that you downloaded to install the Connector.
1. Navigate to the ZIP file and select to extract the files.
2. Select a file location for the extracted installation files.
3. Double-click the EXE file. Then, read and agree to the license agreement.
4. On the Welcome dialog, click **Next**.

7. Select the default mode in which the Connector will run. You can run the Connector as a Windows service or as a desktop application. Aptean Ship will actually install the files necessary to run in both modes, so you can switch to a different mode later if you wish. In this dialog, you're selecting the default mode for the Connector.
You should only select the third option when the Connector is being installed in terminal server/Remote Desktop environments.
For more information about when to choose Windows service vs. desktop application, see the [Aptean Ship Connector](aptean-ship-connector.md) topic.
