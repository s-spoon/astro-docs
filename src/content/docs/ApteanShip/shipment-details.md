The Department Field will also get values mapped from the Source document that do not already exist in the list of Departments. Fields are mapped from Setup > Source Interfaces > "Your Interface" > Interfaces. You can map the Department field to a Source Interface field or to a fixed value.

### Shipment Fields

Aptean Ship allows you to define Shipment User Definable fields of various formats that you can customize and map to Source fields. User Definable field labels and properties are configured in Setup > Preferences > [User Definable Fields](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/user-definable-fields/). To map User Definable fields to source interface fields, use the Customize Interface feature for your interface.
