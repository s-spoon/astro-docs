Aptean Ship only supports 203 DPI printers; printers that are 300 DPI are unsupported. Aptean Ship may work with 203 DPI printers that use EPL2 or ZPL II thermal programming language. The following printers have been tested and certified to work with Aptean Ship and are recommended.

>[!Note] ZPLII printers are preferred for cross-carrier printing consistency. Some carrier labels, such as USPS, require printers that support ZPLII.


>[!Note] Printer model has not been officially tested but is known to function properly.Â  In general, printers with 203 DPI ZPL II language are supported. However, if you encounter any undesired results, it may be due to the printer configuration within the printer driver and/or printer preference settings. We strongly recommend you work with the printer manufacturer to identify and resolve these issues.
