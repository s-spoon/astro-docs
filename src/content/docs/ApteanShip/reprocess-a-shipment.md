This scenario shows you how to reprocess a shipment that you have already processed and need to reopen and edit.
1. Go the **Rate/Ship** section of Aptean Ship.
2. On the left menu, select **Shipments**.
The default filter for shipments is *Status equals 'Open, Processed'*. To view only processed shipments, click the filter, deselect "Open", and click Apply.

3. In the Shipments grid, select the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the shipment row.
4. Aptean Ship will prompt you to choose Yes or No to reopen the shipment.
When you reopen a shipment, its Status is reverted to "Open", thereby voiding any ship or pickup requests associated with the shipment that were made to the carrier. Choose **Yes** to continue.
5. Make the desired changes to the shipment and when you have finished, you can rate the shipment and/or Ship/Process it.


## Label Notes


Any package/pallet labels or other shipment documents that were already printed when you processed the shipment the first time are not automatically reprinted when you reprocess it. You will need to print the new labels manually.

>[!Tip] See [Reprint Labels/Shipping Documents for Processed Shipments](reprint-labels-shipment-documents-for-processed-shipments.md) for further instructions.
