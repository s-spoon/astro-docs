## OnTrac Labels

The OnTrac shipping labels include two barcode symbols, along with the shipping information, on a 4”x 6” label. One of the barcodes (PDF-417) contains important shipping information, such as the Recipient Name, Address, and Zip Code, along with the service offerings requested for the delivery. For more information about managing labels, see Printing Profiles > [Documents](printing-profiles.md#documents).

The two Package Level Reference Fields configured in [OnTrac Settings](ontrac-settings.md) will print on the OnTrac shipping label.

## Shipping Notes


With the OnTrac Web API, you can rate and ship up to 100 packages. OnTrac offers Proof of Delivery verification.
