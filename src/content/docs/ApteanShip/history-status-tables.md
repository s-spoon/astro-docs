History & Status tables are predefined tables in the Dashboard that give users a snapshot of processed shipments by date range or specific filters. For all of these widgets except Shipped/Voided Packages, you can click on a shipment for full shipment detail. These tables are accessible from the Tables menu; you can also define your own tables from [Default Shipment or Packaging Tables](default-tables.md).

## Predefined History & Status Tables

### Shipment History


This table compiles a historical view of shipments based on the defined Period filter.
### Shipped/Voided Packages


This table displays all processed packages by Status : Shipped, Voided, Could Not Void.
### Late Deliveries


This table compiles a list of shipments with a late delivery status and gives a total based on custom charges.
### Declared Value


This table compiles a list of shipments using declared value and estimates possible savings.
## Filters


You can provide specific filters to customize the results that display in a widget window. You can define filters in any of the History & Status tables by clicking the gear icon at the top of the table.

Select a field to filter shipments by and then select an operand (Contains, Begins with, Equals, Not equal, etc.) and type in the filter criteria. The dashboard may auto-complete text entered into the filter field. When adding multiple filters, note that all filters use the "AND" operator.
