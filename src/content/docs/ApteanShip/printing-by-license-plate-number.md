This feature is perfect for users who want to process packages by License Plate Number without printing the shipping labels right away. With Aptean Ship, you can print the labels and/or shipping documents later by scanning the License Plate Number.

Let's say you want to batch process shipments and then print the labels at the end of the day. All you have to do is scan a barcode of the License Plate Number on a package to print the corresponding label.

To print out a label or other document for a previously processed package by entering or scanning a License Plate Number, click **Rate/Ship** on the top menu and then **Shipments** on the side menu.

You can print via License Plate Number on either the Shipments page or the Packages page.
## Shipments
