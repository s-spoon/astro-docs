### Rating

When the shipment information has been entered in Aptean Ship, click Rate Shipment to retrieve the prices and services of all your contracted carriers in the Rate Quotes section.

### General Notes

* If you have a negotiated contract with a carrier that Worldwide Express also supports as a 3PL, your contract rates are used. However, Worldwide Express will provide you
with alternative quotes that you can select.

* Worldwide Express supports up to 6 shipment entries when rating a shipment. If you have more than 6 entries, Aptean Ship may modify packaging, reclassify all entries as
the highest class, or merge BOL entries with the same class and package type into one shipment entry. If Aptean Ship cannot perform any of these actions, you will receive
an error and must manually modify the shipment in order to rate.

* Worldwide Express only supports the Straight BOL. (VICS is not supported.)

* Hazardous Materials shipments are not supported by Worldwide Express.

* Shipments to Alaska and Hawaii are not supported.
