You can customize the Ship Via based on the carrier values set up in your source interface. This allows you to set up value translations between the source interface Ship Via and your carrier values so that Carrier/Service are automatically populated.
1. Select Setup > Source Interfaces > "Your interface."
2. On the Interfaces page, click the **Customize Interface** button for a document (Orders, etc.).

3. Expand the Aptean Ship Field group "**Shipment**" and select "**Carrier Information**".
4. Click the "**Carrier - Service**" field. The "Maps from" field should be set to your source interface and the source document field containing the shipping method value.

5. The Value Translations section shows you how the shipping methods are currently mapped to the Carrier - Service field in Aptean Ship. This is where you can adjust the values for the carrier(s) you added by making selections from the drop-down lists.
