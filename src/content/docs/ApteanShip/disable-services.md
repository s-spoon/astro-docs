Ship Via Rules allow you to disable certain parcel services from Setup > Ship Via Rules > Disable Services. Disabled services will not be accessible when shipping or included during rating and rate shopping.

To use this feature, first check the "Disable specific parcel services" check box to access the list of carriers/services.

### Switch Rule Notes


If you create a [Switch Rule](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/switch-rules/) for a carrier/service you have disabled in Disabled Services, or disable a carrier/service after a rule already exists for it, Aptean Ship will give you a warning message when you click Save in Ship Via Rules Setup.

Also, if a user attempts to process a shipment where the rule would be applied, Aptean Ship will display a warning that the service to switch to is disabled, and then select the next available service based on the Ship Via Rules setting "When selected service is not available, switch to". See [Settings](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/shipvia-settings/) for more information.
