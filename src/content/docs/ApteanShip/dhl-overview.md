Once the XML Services registration has been completed,
* This action will trigger an automated email to the US team for approval, and credentials will be automatically sent upon approval to grant production access.
* Please be aware that it may take 4-5 hours for the credentials to be refreshed in the production environment and become usable.


This will initiate the process of creating a Site ID and Password on the DHL Servers. DHL will then send you the credentials, which you will enter during Aptean Ship setup (see [Account Setup](set-up-dhl-account.md)).
