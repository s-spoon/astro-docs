These instructions show you how to use your own domain to send emails. You will need to add DNS records for your domain.

### Register the Domain in Aptean Ship

To use your own domain for sending eNotify emails, check the "I want to use my own sending domain" check box.

Next, enter the domain name and click **Register**.

### Verify

Generally, it will take a few hours until the records go live, but it could take up to 24 hours for the changes to propagate. Once the records are live, click the **Verify Domain** button. The Registration Status will change to **Verified/Pending**.

Once the Registration Status has changed to "Ready", enter the sending email address that will be used to send eNotify emails. It may take some time until the Registration Status is Ready, and during the interim, the sending email will default to "eNotify@shipping.apteancloud.com" so that Aptean Ship can continue to send eNotify emails.
