Shipment Import offers enhanced flexibility in the handling of shipment data and batches. Shipments can be imported and processed as a batch, including package contents information, generating all of the shipment labels and documents at once.

You can save import settings as a named Import Template, and maintain multiple templates. You can also set up the Import Template to automatically put line items into packages/handling units.

### Set up the Import Template

Before you can import shipments, you'll need to set up an Import Template.

1. [Set up and name the Import Template](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/import-template-setup/).

2. [Customize the field mapping](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/import-template-setup-2/) between input data and Aptean Ship shipment fields.

3. [Configure template settings](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/import-template-setup-3/).
