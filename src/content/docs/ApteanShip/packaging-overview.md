Your Packaging database is administered through Maintain Packaging. From here you can create and define packaging, set default packaging, and view package types.
## Manage Packaging


On the Maintain Packaging page, click the **Add Packaging** button to launch a dialog where you can enter new Packaging information.

If you want to edit an existing Packaging entry, select the Edit button in its row.

To create a more advanced search based on shipment fields, you can build a query that can be saved and reused in Maintain > Packaging. See [Queries](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/maintain-queries/) for more information.

## Packages vs. Handling Units




Packages are identified as the boxes, bags, or other packaging material into which you place items. This packaging can then placed on larger storage units, which are loaded onto trucks. The larger storage units are called Handling Units, the most common forms being pallets, skids, and slips. The **default Package** and **default Handling Unit** are shown at the top of the Packaging grid.

To set default packaging, edit a packaging entry and enable the "Default" check box.

## Packaging Dimensions and Weight


It is important to enter the dimensions and weight of packages and handling units because they factor into the rate you're charged. If the weight is not correct, your shipment may be audited by the carrier, possibly costing you extra time and additional fees.
