These settings apply to all Worldwide Express accounts and can be accessed from Setup > Carrier Interfaces > Worldwide Express > Settings.

Reference fields allow you to print additional information on the BOL using a reference field, such as the PO#, or any other information that may not normally appear in a shipment’s details. Reference fields can be mapped to Aptean Ship shipment fields in order to allow you to include shipment information on the BOL. These fields are uploaded to the carrier when the shipment is processed and should show on the carrier invoice.

Worldwide Express supports 10 Shipment Level Reference Fields.

Specify the shipment fields to include as reference fields by selecting them from the drop-down lists. You can type into the magnifying glass field to search for and select another shipment field.

>[!Tip] For more information, see [Reference Fields](carrier-reference-fields.md).
