## Addresses


A company can have multiple addresses linked to it, each separate address having its own Address ID so that it can be easily selected in the Shipment Editor (Ship screen) while shipping, or mapped in Aptean Ship.

To add a new address, click the **New Address** button.

### Address Information


The Company information entered on this window corresponds to the Address ID (in the Sender section) when processing shipments. In general, the "MAIN" address is used as the default Company Address.
### Address ID


An Address ID identifies an address that you add for a company. The first address you set up will be "MAIN," which is the default value. You can then create alternate sender addresses for the same company.

## Accounts


If you have multiple carrier accounts, each Address ID can be associated with a different default carrier account when rating and shipping.

In the Accounts section, select the account to use for each carrier interface from the Account drop-down list. You can also choose "Do Not Use", or "Use Default" which will use the designated default account for that carrier interface (set under Setup > Carrier Interfaces).
