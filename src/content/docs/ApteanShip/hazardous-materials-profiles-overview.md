The Hazardous Materials Profiles feature allows you to create predefined Hazardous Materials descriptions, which are saved in a profile. Each profile contains all the data needed to identify Hazardous Materials tendered for shipping. You can then assign these profiles at various levels of the shipment. You can also import your existing Hazardous Materials or Dangerous Goods Profiles into Aptean Ship.

Aptean Ship supports hazardous freight and parcel shipments for all carriers except DHL, USPS, and OnTrac. Aptean Ship can generate shipping forms for UPS and FedEx, as well as the HazMat BOL for freight carriers, which can be set up in [Printing Profiles](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/printing-profiles/). It is your responsibility as the shipper to ensure that your shipments have the appropriate documentation and that all forms are accurate and complete.

Hazardous Materials Profiles are created in Maintain > Hazardous Material Profiles.
