### Search Customers


Add filters or type directly into the Search field to find specific Customers. The first column defines the Search field criteria. To change the Search field, you can drag a column to the first position.

To create a more advanced search based on shipment fields, you can build a query that can be saved and reused in Maintain > Customers. See [Queries](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/maintain-queries/) for more information.
