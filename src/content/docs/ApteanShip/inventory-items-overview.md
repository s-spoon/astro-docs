Your Inventory Items database is administered through Maintain Inventory Items. From here you can define item, hazardous, packaging scenarios, international details, as well as user-defined fields.

For more in-depth information, see the [Inventory Items](inventory-items.md) section.

## Manage Inventory Items


On the Maintain Inventory Items page, click the **Add Inventory Item** button to launch a dialog where you can enter new Inventory Item information.

If you want to edit an existing Inventory Item, select the Edit button in its row.

## Search Inventory Items


Add filters or type directly into the Item Number field to find an Inventory item. The first column defines the Search field criteria. To change the Search field, you can drag a column to the first position.

To create a more advanced search based on shipment fields, you can build a query that can be saved and reused in Maintain Inventory Items. See [Queries](queries.md) for more information.
