The UPS SurePost® service provides you with the ability to ship non-urgent ground residential shipments at a reduced cost. Shippers will have the ability to ship four different UPS and USPS delivered product types.

UPS SurePost is a contract service for ground packages ranging in weight from 1 ounce to 70 pounds. The service is available for US post office boxes, APO/FPO addresses, and US territories.

The UPS options available for SurePost are Quantum View Notify and UPS Carbon Neutral. The following SurePost services are supported:

* UPS SurePost® Standard
* UPS SurePost® Bound Printed Matter
* UPS SurePost® Media


### UPS SurePost Setup

When shipping from multiple locations with a single account, you can use the Cost Center to differentiate between locations. In the field provided, enter a **Cost Center code** and click **Add**. The code may be alphanumeric and is limited to 50 characters. You can add multiple cost centers, which appear in the list below. The Cost Center is optional for both Mail Innovations and SurePost shipments.

1. In the Shipment Editor > Transportation section, select UPS as the Carrier and UPS SurePost as the Service. Then select Media, Standard, or Bound Printed Matter in the USPS Services field.

3. You'll also notice that USPS Endorsement is automatically selected. This option is required in order to request a recipient’s new address and to provide USPS with instructions on how to handle undeliverable packages. Select the type of Endorsement you want from the drop-down list. The default is "Address Service Requested".
