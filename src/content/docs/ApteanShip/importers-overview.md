Maintain Importers allows you to add and maintain Importer information for international shipments. The Importers you set up here are available under Transportation > Details (Importers drop-down list) when processing an international shipment. You can also add importers on the fly while shipping.
## Manage Importers


On the Maintain > Importers page, click the Add Importer button to launch a dialog where you can enter a new Importer.

To create a more advanced search based on shipment fields, you can build a query that can be saved and reused in Maintain > Importers. See [Queries](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/maintain-queries/) for more information.
## On the Ship Screen


The Importer can be selected while shipping in the Transportation > Details section of the Ship screen.
