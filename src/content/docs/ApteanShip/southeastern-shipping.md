The Southeastern Freight Lines module allows you to rate and ship via the Internet, giving you live access to negotiated rates. In addition, you can track shipments, request pickups, generate the BOL, and get the PRO # from Southeastern. Aptean Ship generates the BOL and prints package and pallet labels.

Southeastern supports LTL shipments to destinations in the USA (excluding Alaska and Hawaii) and Canada.

### Rating

When rating a shipment, Southeastern Freight may sometimes reply that the rate must be emailed. In this case, the shipment cannot be processed electronically and will be treated as a manual shipment. Southeastern Freight Supports up to 20 items per rate request. If set to electronic tendering, up to 10 items per shipment are supported.

### Tracking

Shipments are tracked by PRO Number. Only posted shipments can be tracked using the Track Shipment button in the Shipment Status section.

### Proof of Delivery

When the shipment's status is Delivered, you can click the button next to the PRO # in the Transportation section to get the Proof of Delivery form in PDF format.
