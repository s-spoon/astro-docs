The End of Day close process uploads processed shipment and package information to carriers that support it. When you run End of Day, shipment statuses are changed to "Posted."

You can post your shipments in Aptean Ship by individual carrier and specific carrier accounts. End of Day close-out can be performed multiple times per day. Once you post shipments, Aptean Ship prints all the End of Day documents that you enabled. You can also view posted shipments from End of Day History.
## Post Shipments


End of Day is accessible from the left menu when you are in Rate/Ship mode. Carriers appear at the highest level in the grid, and can be expanded to reveal the account numbers and the Service used to ship.

All shipments that have been processed and have a ready date on or before the date selected in the "Total Packages on or before " field are accounted for in the totals. Uncheck any carrier or account that you do not want to post. Click the **Post** button to run End of Day.

>[!Note] FedEx shipments will be automatically posted at 4 a.m. based on the Account Time Zone set in [FedEx Account Settings](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/setup_fedex/#settings). 

Once shipments are posted, the results window displays the status for each carrier you closed out, and any error messages.


## End of Day History


Once a shipment is posted, you can view details and status in End of Day History.  You can utilize the filters at the top of the window to display specific shipments, by Posted Date(s) including a date range, by carrier, or by status.
