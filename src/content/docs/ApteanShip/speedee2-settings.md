Reference fields allow the recipient to track incoming packages using a reference field (such as the PO#) along with the ship date, your shipper number, or other information that may not usually appear in the package details. Aptean Ship supports **2 Reference fields** at the package level.

Specify the shipment fields as reference fields by selecting them from the drop-down lists. You can select from the default list or **Advancedâ€¦** to choose from a list of fields. You can also select the data source from which fields are displayed. Use the magnifying glass to search shipment fields using a search filter. The **Label Tag** column allows you to change the default tag on the label to a label of your choosing.
