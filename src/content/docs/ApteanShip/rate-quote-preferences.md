Rate Quote Preferences affect the types of charges (List, Contract, Applied) that display in the Rate Quotes and Charge Summary grid.

For both options, specify the types of charges that should appear in the Rate Quotes grid and also the Charges Summary table.
## List Charges


These are the standard published charges from the carrier (Parcel only).
## Contract Charges


These are the carrier charges based on your contract (including any of your discounts, etc.).
## Applied Charges


These are the Contract charges, modified by freight rules or handling charges.
