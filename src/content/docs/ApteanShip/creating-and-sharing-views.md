In addition to the default Views provided by V-Technologies, you can create and share your own Views. Only the Views created and saved by the current user, or shared with that user, will display in the Dashboard. For example, if I save a View named Shipment History, it will be available from my Views menu, but when another user logs in, only the Views he created and saved will be listed in his Views menu.

1. From the Views menu, click **Create New View**.

2. A blank View with the default name of View1 is created. To rename it, click the menu and select **Rename**.

## Sharing Views


To share a View you have created, select **Share** from the menu next to the View. The View will be shared with all other users.

## Open Shared Views


To load a View that has been shared, select the **Open Shared Views** menu item.

The Shared Views dialog shows all shared views by User. You can pin a shared View to your Views menu or delete Views. If you delete a shared View, it will be deleted from the Shared Views dialog for all users; however, it will not delete the actual pinned View from the Views menu if you or another user has already added it.
