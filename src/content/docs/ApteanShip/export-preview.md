You can preview the appearance and data in the export file from the Shipment Export screen. Once you have selected the Export Template and Export Fields Template, and configured filters, Aptean Ship can provide you with a preview of how the shipments will be exported.

This screen is available from the Shipments page > Export button. Click the **Preview** button.

Data from the export fields, in the order and with the headers you configured in the Export Fields Template, populate the screen. If more than one page of records are returned, you can page through the records by clicking the Next link.
