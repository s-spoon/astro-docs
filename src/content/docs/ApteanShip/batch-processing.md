4. Configure **Batch Settings**by making the following selections and then clicking **OK**:
	* Batch Name: Enter a name to identify the current batch in Aptean Ship.
	* Action: Choose whether you want Aptean Ship to process the shipment(s) with or without printing labels and documents.
	* On Error: If any errors should occur during processing, select the action Aptean Ship should take. The shipment(s) can be saved as a draft or skipped, or you can choose to abort the import process completely. To allow the user to select one of these actions on a case-by-case basis, select "prompt user for action". In the case of an error, after the batch is processed, the user can then click on the Batch Process Notifications icon and make a selection.
	* On Duplicate: If one or more shipments with the same document key exists in the database, you can choose to create a new shipment or skip the duplicate. To allow the user to select the action to take, set this field to "prompt user for action". After the batch is processed, the user can then click on the Batch Process Notifications icon and make a selection.
	* Merge Related Orders: This setting appears if you checked the "Retrieve related documents when shipping" setting in Source Interface Setup > "Your Interface" > Options. Check this option to merge the related orders into one shipment and process that shipment. You can also save the shipment as a draft.![](assets/images/aptean-shipping-software-batch-processing4-1.png)

If you selected to prompt the user when there are errors or duplicates in Batch Settings, this is where the user can select the action to take. In this example, the user can save the batch as a draft or skip it.
