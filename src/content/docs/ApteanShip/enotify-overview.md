The eNotify option enables you to send shipment email notifications through Aptean Ship instead of using carrier notification options. It includes a Template Designer and Email Viewer .

eNotify allows for real-time notification when a shipment is processed, edited, or voided. You can create multiple email templates for different uses. Aptean Ship also allows you to create custom templates for your company that let you:
* insert variable fields, including line-item data, from a source interface;
* add logos or other company branding;
* create links to your website.


Another benefit to using eNotify is that you can send email notifications for any carrier that Aptean Ship supports. Shipping documents generated by Aptean Ship can be attached to email notifications as PDFs; for example, the Commercial Invoice, NAFTA, Certificate of Origin, BOL, Packing List, etc. This also includes the ability to control PDF file names using parameters such as customer name, Transaction Number, PO #, and more.

>[!Tip] **Web browser notes**
>* If you are using the Microsoft Edge web browser, we recommend that you use the latest version of Edge (v44.18362.267.0 or higher) due to issues with earlier versions.
>* Internet Explorer is not supported for eNotify.


## User Roles


The eNotify feature is enabled for users in the SMS, under Users & Roles. Make sure to enable eNotify for any users or roles who need access to it.
