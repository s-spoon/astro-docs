This topic covers how to log in to Aptean Ship and the Subscription Management System.

The Subscription Management System (SMS) and Aptean Ship use the Single Sign-on authentication process. As a result, when you navigate to either application and log in, you will be logged into both applications.
## Log in from the SMS


Navigate to the SMS and log in. The URL for your SMS dashboard login follows this formula: "https://*companycode*.subscription.shipping.apteancloud.com". Aptean sends you the company code in the Aptean Ship welcome email. Check the "Keep me signed in" check box to stay signed in to the SMS and Aptean Ship until you manually log out. You will be logged in for 1 year. See also: [Logging Out](logging-in-to-aptean-ship.md#logging-out).
