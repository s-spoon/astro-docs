The first step in setting up Shipment Import is to import a file containing your shipment data and use that data to create an Import Template. In this initial setup, you'll use your data to define input fields so that Aptean Ship understands what type of data is in each field. You can define and save multiple Import Templates.

>[!Tip] **About Import Templates** <br>Import Templates allow you to take the standardized data format generated by your source interface and define how this data is imported into Aptean Ship, what fields are populated with which data (field mapping), and also translate the imported values into shipment values in Aptean Ship (value translations).
## Import Shipment Data


Follow these steps to import your data.
1. Click **Rate/Ship** on the menu bar.

## Define Input Columns


Once the data file is loaded, the next step is to define the file columns in terms of the type of shipment data a column contains, and the columns to import.
## Data Level and Primary Key


On the next dialog, you'll be asked to choose the data level for each field and assign a Primary Key. "Data Level" means the type of shipment data a column will contain:  Shipment, Order, Line Item, Package, Package Contents, or Handling Units. The Primary Key is the input column that contains the “key” data for a specific data level. For example, package contents can be added to specific packages using the package Primary Key.

Together, these items will specify the type of information being transferred from the import file into Aptean Ship and where that data should be assigned.

>[!Tip] Click the Auto Select button to set the data levels automatically based on the most common settings.

**Shipment fields**

Recipient information can be mapped to the Recipient fields in Aptean Ship. If the customer already exists in the Aptean Ship Customer database, Aptean Ship can use the Customer ID to identify the recipient and automatically populate recipient information. Examples of recipient fields:
* Customer ID: The customer name or number;
* Address fields: Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip
* Phone or Email: These fields are required by some carriers in order to process a shipment.


**Order Fields**

Order fields could include the document ID, such as Order Number, which can be used as the Primary Key for the Shipment or Order data level.

**Line Item fields**

Line Item fields contain information about the items being shipped, such as Item Number, Item Quantity, Item Description, Item Weight, Units Ordered, Units Shipped, etc. Line items can be added to an order using the order Primary Key.
>[!Note] The Line Item data level does not require you to specify a Primary Key.

**Package and Packaging Contents fields**

The combination of Package and Package Contents fields will allow you to place items from the order into specific packages upon import.
**Package Fields -** Package fields could include the Package Number, Weight, and Dimensions.


**Packaging Contents** - Packaging Contents fields could include the Package Contents Item Number, Package Contents Item Quantity, Package Contents Doc #, etc.


**Handling Unit fields** 

Use these fields to import handling unit information, such as the Pallet ID, Type, etc.
### Review and Name the Template


The final step is to review the columns you defined, along with the data level and Primary Key (indicated by a check mark) that were specified for each. Click **Finish** to save the template, or **Back** to make changes.

>[!Note] **Next Steps** <br>After clicking Finish, you'll be brought back to the Shipment Import Setup screen where you can move on to the next steps of setting up import with this template:
>* [Customize Import Mapping](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/import-template-setup-2/) - Map the input columns to Aptean Ship shipment fields so that shipment data is imported correctly.
>* [Import Template Settings](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/import-template-setup-3/) - Configure additional settings for batch import and handling of shipment data.
