This section sets general SMC³ settings and applies to all accounts. These settings can be accessed from Setup > Carrier Interfaces > SMC³ > Main.

### Disable use of SMC³ Interface

Check this option to disable the SMC³ carrier engine.SMC³ is still available for rating or shipping if selected as a carrier for Freightview or Freightquote.


### Enable background tracking

Background tracking collects shipment data so that you can look up delivery information for past shipments and generate late deliveries reports from the Aptean Ship Dashboard.

### Supported Carriers

This section lists carriers supported by SMC³, their SCAC code, and carrier type. Carriers are loaded based on the SMC³ contracts you enter. Because the carriers shown in this list correlate to the contracts you add and delete on the Contract Details page, it is currently not possible to directly add or delete carriers here. Once carriers have been added based on your contracts, however, you may disable a carrier on the Accounts page for that carrier.

### Supported Billing Types

This section displays the supported Billing Types available for SMC³.

### Supported Options
