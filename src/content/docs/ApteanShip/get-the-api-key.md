Before you can set up an account in Aptean Ship, you'll need the API key from the B2B Tools section of the R+L website. You are assigned the API key when you register an account for API access.

To get your API key or to register an account for API access, follow these instructions.
1. Click the link to access the [MyRLC login page](http://www2.rlcarriers.com/freight/shipping-software/freight-api-setup).
2. Enter the username and password for the account and click **Login**.
    >[!Tip] **Don't have an account?** <br> If you don't already have an account, click the "Sign up for a MyRLC account!" button. You can then create an account and use your newly created login credentials to continue. 
3. On the B2B Tools setup page, activate all B2B tools.
4. Locate the API Key and copy it to use in Aptean Ship account setup.
