Maintain Brokers displays your Brokers database for International shipments, and allows you to add and configure your Brokers.
### Manage Brokers


On the Maintain Brokers page, click the Add Broker button to launch a dialog where you can enter a new Broker.

If you want to edit an existing Broker entry, select the Edit button in its row.

### Search Brokers


Add filters or type directly into the Search field to find specific Brokers. The first column defines the Search field criteria. To change the Search field, you can drag a column to the first position.

To create a more advanced search based on shipment fields, you can build a query that can be saved and reused in Maintain > Packaging. See [Queries](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/maintain-queries/) for more information.
