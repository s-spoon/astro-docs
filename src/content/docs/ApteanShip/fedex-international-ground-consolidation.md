FedEx International Ground Consolidation (IGC) is a new service that offers cost-efficient, reliable shipping from FedEx International Ground with the added benefit of automatic shipment consolidation when you ship to or from Canada. Unless you opt to exclude a package from consolidation, FedEx consolidates all qualifying packages for you, en route, at no extra cost. Consolidated packages clear customs as one shipment, saving on brokerage fees.

## Requirements

You must be set up as an IGC shipper by your FedEx account executive. Packages that are eligible for IGC consolidation will be consolidated for customs clearance.
