### Shipment Pickup Requests


If you set the "Req. Shipment Pickup" option to checked, Aptean Ship will send a pickup request to Roadrunner when the shipment is successfully processed. The Ship/Process Results will confirm the pickup and display the service center that will be handling the pickup.

A Roadrunner Quick Pickup Request email confirmation is sent to the email entered in the Sender section. This email contains the Pickup Request #, the service center handling the request, and other information.
### Tracking


Shipments are tracked by PRO Number. The PRO Number must be scanned or entered manually, and is then stored by Aptean Ship. Only posted shipments can be tracked using the Track Shipment button in the Shipment Status section.
