Aptean Ship directly integrates with ABF Freight to provide rating, shipping, tracking, and pickup requests via the Internet for LTL shipments to the USA (including Alaska and Hawaii) and Canada. Aptean Ship also prints the BOL, package, and pallet labels.
>[!Note] To disable ABF Freight, check the Disable use of ABF Freight option on the Main tab; when disabled, the ABF Freight carrier engine is disabled, though it can still be selected as a carrier for Enterprise TMS or Freightquote.

The Accounts page is where you set up the account information for your ABF Freight account(s) and also edit or delete accounts.

	* Default Prepaid Billing Type : This is the default Billing Type for shipments that are paid for by the shipper. You can select from Sender or any other 3PL that you set up in [Maintain > 3PL](3pl-overview.md). This setting affects the options available under Billing on the Shipment tab.
