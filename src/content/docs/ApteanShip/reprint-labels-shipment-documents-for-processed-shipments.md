You can print package and pallet labels, and other shipment documents, that were generated for a shipment you already processed. This includes labels that were printed using the [Print On Next](print-on-next.md) feature, or if you reprocess a shipment and need to print new labels.
1. In Rate/Ship, select **Shipments** from the left menu.
2. View the shipment by clicking the **View** button (magnifying glass icon) on the shipment row.
