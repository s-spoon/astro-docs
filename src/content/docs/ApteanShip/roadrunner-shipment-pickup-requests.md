## How it works


Once the shipment is successfully processed, the pickup is scheduled. The Ship/Process Results will confirm the pickup, and display the service center that will be handling the pickup. For example, "Pickup Schedule to RRTS Terminal : Charlotte (800) 582-9292."
## Requirements


Sender Contact, Email, and Phone Number are required for shipment pickup. The Sender Email address will receive the Roadrunner Quick Pickup Request email confirmation with shipment pickup information.
## Limitations


* Shipment Pickup requests can only be made for outgoing shipments.
* Roadrunner currently does not support pickup requests for drop-shipments.
