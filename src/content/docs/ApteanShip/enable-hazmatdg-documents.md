It's important that you set up the documents you'll need to include with your Hazardous Materials or Dangerous Good shipments before you start shipping. You can do this in Setup > Printing & Scale > [Printing Profiles](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/printing-profiles/).

On the Printing Profiles page, select the Profile that you use to ship HazMat/DG and click the Edit button.
