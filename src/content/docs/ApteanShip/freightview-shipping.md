Â 

Continue packaging the shipment, adding any other shipment detail and selecting any shipment options you want to use. Then, process the shipment as you normally would.
## BOL


In general, when shipping with Freightview carriers, the BOL is not returned to Aptean Ship when you process a shipment unless you also request a shipment pickup.
Freightview requires a pickup for those carriers.
