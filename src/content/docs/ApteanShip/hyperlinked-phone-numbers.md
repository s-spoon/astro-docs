In the Microsoft Edge browser, phone numbers will appear as clickable hyperlinks. Clicking on a number will launch Skype (if you have it installed), the default dialing application on your computer, or your default browser.

These hyperlinks will appear in any grid in Aptean Ship, such as Maintain Customers or Maintain Brokers.
