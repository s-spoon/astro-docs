You can ship Dangerous Goods shipments with FedEx Express and Hazardous Materials shipments with FedEx Ground.
## Required Forms


FedEx requires the following forms when shipping Hazardous Materials/Dangerous Goods. They can be set up in [Printing Profiles](printing-profiles.md). See [Enable HazMat/DG Documents](enable-hazmatdg-documents.md) for more information.

* FedEx Express requires the Shippers Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
* FedEx Ground requires the FedEx HazMat Certificate and the FedEx Ground HazMat Shipping Form (OP900)


## Preferences Setup

Another setting that affects how Hazardous Materials detail is populated when shipping is the Hazardous Materials Preference that, when checked, allows Aptean Ship to control the Hazardous Materials option and assign the Profile for a package based on its line items. This setting can be found in Preferences > Preferences > [Hazardous Materials Preferences](hazardous-materials-preferences.md).

## Process a Shipment


The following steps show you how to process a Hazardous Materials/Dangerous Goods shipment for FedEx.

Select **Rate/Ship** from the top menu. Select the source document you want to ship and click the **Create Shipment** button.

When line items that are designated as Hazardous are on the shipment, Hazardous Materials information is automatically populated. The Hazardous option is checked and the HazMat Profile populated (if applicable).

You can also check the Hazardous Materials option manually at the **package level** under Packaging or the Dangerous Goods option under Package Details, as well as assign a predefined Hazardous Materials Profile.

>[!Tip] Aptean Ship allows you to maintain a database of hazardous goods (using the Maintain Hazardous Materials Profiles feature) that you can select from while shipping. For more information about setup, see [Hazardous Materials Profiles](hazardous-materials-profiles.md).



The Dangerous Goods option in Shipment Details will be automatically enabled, along with the Signature Option: Direct Signature Required.
