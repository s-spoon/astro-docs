Aptean Ship allows you to use your eCommerce company as an extension to your ERP interface or accounting software, allowing you to write shipment information back to eCommerce orders. You'll need to have your eCommerce company or companies set up in Aptean Ship in order to be able to select them while setting up the eCommerce extension.
## Setup


To use eCommerce as an extension, select Setup > Source Interfaces > "Your Source Interface" > Companies. In the Company row, select the eCommerce company from the "Write back to eCommerce" drop-down list.
