The Subscription Management System controls Dashboard access for each user login. Only the Aptean Ship user "Admin" has Dashboard access by default. Logins to the Aptean Ship Dashboard do not count towards your licensed seats.

>[!Note] Users will be logged off after 30 minutes of inactivity. Closing the Dashboard window or clicking "Log off" will also log a user off.
## SMS Setup


Do this for each user who will be running the Dashboard.
1. In the Aptean SMS, select Tools > Users to launch the User Manager.
2. Select the user from the User List and click **User Roles**.
3. Select the **Dashboard** role on the right and click the left arrow to add it to the current User Roles for this user.
4. Click **OK** to save.
