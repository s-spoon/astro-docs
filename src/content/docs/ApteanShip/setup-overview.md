## Ready vs. Not Ready


Some sections in Setup will display Ready/Not Ready indicators. You need to set up these areas in order to be ready to ship.

Sections that need to be set up in order to ship will display the Not Ready indicator.

When a section needed for shipping is complete, you'll see the Ready indicator.

## Set vs. Not Set


Other sections, such as Ship Via Rules and Custom Fields, are optional to set up. Though they play a part in shipping, you can choose to set them up or not. They are not necessary to start shipping.

## Remember Last Location


When you exit Setup and return to it during the same Aptean Ship session, it will save your place and return you to that location. This only occurs for the Setup section of Aptean Ship, and only if you are in the same tab of the same browser window. When you close the tab or browser window, the session is reset.
