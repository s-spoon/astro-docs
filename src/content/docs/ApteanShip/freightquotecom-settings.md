This page allows you to configure rate shopping for Freightquote.com.
## When rate shopping, only return rates for Contract Carriers


With this option checked, Aptean Ship will only show rates for your contract carriers, rather than all Freightquote carriers. Rate shopping will normally return all the carriers supported by Freightquote.com and may also include any contract carriers that were loaded onto your account. When this setting is enabled, rate shopping will only return valid contract carriers.
