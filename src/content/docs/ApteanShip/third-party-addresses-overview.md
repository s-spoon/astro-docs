To create a more advanced search based on shipment fields, you can build a query that can be saved and reused in Maintain > Third Party Addresses. See [Queries](http://ask.shipping.apteancloud.com/akb/maintain-queries/) for more information.

### On the Ship Screen

The Third Party Address can be selected while shipping in the Transportation section of the Ship screen. You can also add Third Party Addresses on-the-fly by clicking the pencil icon.
