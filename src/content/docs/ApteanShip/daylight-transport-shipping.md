### Rating


When rating, items are grouped based on the BOL Preference “Group Items on BOL” in [Setup > Preferences > Bill of Lading](bill-of-lading.md).
### BOL


After processing a shipment, Daylight Transport returns the BOL in PDF format in Aptean Ship. To reprint the BOL, open the shipment and navigate to the Shipping Documents section. You can view or reprint the BOL there.
