With FedEx® Returns, you can create and print a return label and include it in the original shipment to your recipient. You can also email a label to your recipient. The recipient can then apply this label to the return package as needed and drop the package off at a FedEx drop off location. No charges are assessed until the label is used. In addition, a Return Materials Authorization (RMA) reference field (printed on the label and your invoice) is available to help you track your return shipments.

Aptean Ship supports domestic Return Shipments for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments. Return shipments are available for FedEx First Overnight®, FedEx Priority Overnight®, FedEx Standard Overnight®, FedEx 2Day®, FedEx Ground®, FedEx Home Delivery®, FedEx 2Day® Freight, FedEx 3Day® Freight, and FedEx Ground® Economy shipments throughout all 50 states.

## Label Options


**Print Return Label/FedEx Ground Economy Print Return Label**: You can print a return label to insert into the box of an outbound shipment.
