Aptean may have created custom documentation for your company, such as custom labels, packing lists, BOL forms, or other shipping documents. You can easily import them using Custom Documents in Setup > Printing & Scale. This setup area allows you to add and delete your custom documents.
## Import Custom Documents


1. On the Custom Documents screen, click the **Import** button.

3. On the next dialog, check the check box next to the file name(s) and click the **Import Selected** button.
	* **Overwrite existing templates**: Check this option if you want Aptean Ship to replace the existing template of the same name with the new one. If you do not check this option, Aptean Ship will skip over any existing templates with the same name and those templates will not be imported.

## Deleting Custom Documents


You can delete custom documents from the Custom Documents page. In order to delete a custom document that has already been added to a Printing Profile, you must first go into Printing Profiles and uncheck the "Enabled" check box for the document. You can then delete the document from the Custom Documents page.
