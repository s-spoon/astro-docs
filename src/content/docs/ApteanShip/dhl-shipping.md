## Service Options


### Additional Protection


This option enables the cost of additional protection (i.e. shipping insurance). You can select how to apply the additional protection: divide the amount among all packages in the shipment, or apply the amount to every package. Enter the Base Amount and the fee for this option will display in the upper right corner.
### Handling Fee


You can set how to apply the Handling Fee to the shipment:
* Divide Between Packages - The handling fee amount is divided equally among all packages in the shipment.
* Apply to:
	+ Packages Individually - The handling fee is applied on a package by package basis, and the Base Amount is set up for individual packages.
	+ Every Package - The handling fee amount is applied to each package in the shipment.


### Handling Fee Type


* Flat Amount - Aptean Ship adds the dollar amount you enter to the package(s).
* Percentage of freight - This percentage value will be used to calculate a handling fee based on the actual freight charges. So, if you enter 10, then 10% of the freight charges will be added as a handling fee.
* Min.$ and Max.$ - This is the minimum or maximum dollar amount that can be charged when the handling fee is calculated as a percentage. If you don't want to define a limit, leave the default $0.00.


### Base Amount


The base amount is automatically calculated and can be added to or subtracted from the Applied Amount by clicking the Add or Subtract radio buttons.
### Applied Amount


This is the handling fee that will be charged. The applied amount only displays when one or more freight rules have been used to modify the handling fee.
### Handling Fee Freight Rules


When Package or Shipment Handling Fee rules have been set up for DHL and the conditions of a rule has been met, the Handling Fee check box is automatically enabled in the Shipment Editor. For some shipments, you may not want to charge a handling fee even if handling fee rules apply. To allow the user to de-select the Handling Fee option when you have freight rules configured, you can set up a rule that uses the Handling Fee check box as a condition (checked or unchecked). So you can set up the rule to say that if the Handling Fee option is unchecked under options, don't apply a handling fee.
### Email notification


Email notification allows you to send a shipment notification message to up to 5 email addresses. This email includes the shipment number and a link to the DHL website where the shipment can be tracked. The currently available type of notification is:

* Recipients - You can specify up to five recipients (Sender, Other, or Recipient) and their email addresses. Click the Additional Settings button to access all 5 Notification recipients.
