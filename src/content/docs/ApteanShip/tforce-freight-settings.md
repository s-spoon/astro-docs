### Reference Fields

Reference fields allow you to print additional information on the BOL using a reference field, such as the PO#, or any other information that may not normally appear in a shipmentâ€™s details. Aptean Ship supports up to 5 different Reference fields at the shipment level for TForce Freight. Reference fields are uploaded to Tforce Freight at end-of-day processing.

Specify the shipment fields to include as reference fields by selecting them from the drop-down lists. You can type into the magnifying glass field to search for and select another shipment field.

>[!Tip] For more information, see [Reference Fields](carrier-reference-fields.md).
