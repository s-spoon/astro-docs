## FAQâ€™s

**Q1. Create and Complete button is not available on quick work order?**

**Answer**:  
The Create and Complete buttons on the Quick Work Order may remain disabled
unless the following configuration is set:
* **Enable**: Allow immediate completion of Routine Work Orders.
* **Disable**: Utilize the Work Order Approval Process.

It's important to note that the work order approval feature may not be applicable to all users. For
instance, if a company employs the Mobile approval feature, this option is automatically disabled
by default. Conversely, if the Mobile approval feature is not in use, the work order approval
process can be configured within the security group sections. Refer to the steps outlined below.
