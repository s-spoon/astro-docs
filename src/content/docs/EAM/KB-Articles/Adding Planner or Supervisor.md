## Q1. How do I add a planner to the system?

**Answer**:  
Planners and Supervisors are not validation codes in EAM. An employee who is a Planner or
Supervisor can have a code associated with his ID, that is his Planner or Supervisor code. The
user can enter any text value for the Planner or Supervisor code, directly into the Employee
module, on the Configuration tab. The employee's supervisor can be designated with a supervisor
code.

Consider an example of where Planner/Supervisor is/are used in the application. The selected
employee has WorkOrder Codes as Planner123 and Supervisor123 as shown below.

The **PM Schedule** module can generate PM work orders for a specific **Planner** and/or
**Supervisor**. The Planner or Supervisor code is then available, as a drop-down list, in the areas of
EAM which allow Planner and Supervisor assignment as shown below.

The Work Order has a place to select the Planner and/or Supervisor for the work order as shown
below.
