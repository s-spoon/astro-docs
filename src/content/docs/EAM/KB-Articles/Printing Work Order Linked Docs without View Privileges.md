**Solution**:  
In the current system design, the process of printing work orders with attached
documents is streamlined. Documents flagged as Print with work order can be easily printed
without requiring users to have access to the Documents panel or the privilege to view specific
documents. This intentional behavior ensures that users can generate comprehensive Work
Order documents that include all relevant information, even if they do not have the privilege to
individually view each linked document.
