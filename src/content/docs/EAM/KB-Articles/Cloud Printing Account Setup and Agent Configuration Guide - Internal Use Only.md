## Create Cloud Printing Account

To create a cloud printing account, perform the following steps:
1. Go to Account Services page in production environment, or to the Swagger UI page for
Aptean Cloud Print Services.

    1. For Account Services page in production environment, go to
    https://print.api.apteancloud.com/swagger-ui.html%23/account-services in a browser.
    The browser prompts for username and password.  
    Enter the **AccountId** and **APIkey** of the master account as **Username** and **Password**,
    and click **Sign In**.

    2. For Swagger UI page, go to https://print.api.apteancloud.com/swagger-ui.html#/ in a
    browser.
    It requires UserName and Password to login. Use the following details as username
    and password.
        * accountId: 4572cfbc37e545acb3cb54d023b0714d
        * apiKey: API337ff2199f0d4676b44461aecfb5ebff

    > [!Note]  
    > Do not share the above account details to customer.

2. Generate the child accounts for each customer.

    > [!Note]  
    > Each tenant or customer requires a separate account as the account isolates
    the customersâ€™ agents, printers, and jobs from other users of the service.

3. Under **Account Services**, click the **POST** request, and then click the **Try it out** button.

4. Update the strings of the registerRequest parameter as follows:
    * **company** - A free form text that is the company name of the customer. There is no limit
    on size.
    * **contact** - A free form text that is the contact name or address of the customer. There is
    no limit on size.
    * **email** - Enter the (for example) test@aptean.com email address. This field is critical as
    it is used by the /recover API to get back the account details through email if the users
    lose their account information.
    * **group** - An optional field, free form again, however, this is the group to which the user
    belongs.
    * Refer the below image for a sample:

        ![](../assets/kb-articles/Cloud_Print/CP3.jpg)

5. After updating the strings, click the Execute button.
6. Wait for few minutes, an account will be generated in the Response body. This is the
account generated for a customer which contains AccountID, APIKey, and AgentKey.
7. Click the Download button to save the account information in a .JSON file.
8. You can provide the following details to the customer (for Production mode)
    * Account ID
    * API Key
    * Agent Key

    > [!Note]  
    > For Staging mode, please confirm the Print Agent Host URL with the Cloud Printing
