In the EAM application, Integration jobs can be scheduled for a specific duration to run and execute. When the integration task is on run, the related functional data will be updated in the database. Users can schedule and run the following integration jobs in the Task Management Portal.

## Integration Jobs

Integration jobs are automated processes designed to enable the transfer of data between diverse systems or components. Our integration solutions support two methodologies: API and Batch jobs.

-   **Batch Jobs**: Exchange data via files (data format: XML) at a predefined interval.
-   **API**: Exchange data online/synchronous using API (data format: XML)

The same validation would apply to both of the above methods.  
The document explains the jobs with reference to batch jobs. Having said that, while utilizing the API, the job name specified for batch processing remains the same and needs to be provided as input.

## Types of integrated jobs

**Export Job**: An export job involves extracting data from a source system, formatting it, and transmitting it to a target system or destination.  
**Example**: Exporting requisition data to an ERP system.

**Import Job**: An import job entails receiving data from an external source, validating it, and integrating it into a target system or database.  
**Example**: Importing new stock arrivals or inventory adjustments from a supplier's system into the inventory management system.

## Steps followed for all Integration jobs

-   **Receive File**: Data is received from the source system, whether through direct transfer, file upload, or API request.
-   **Validate**: The received data is validated to ensure it meets the specified format, quality, and integrity standards.
-   **Process**: Validated data is processed according to predefined rules, transformations, or logic to prepare it for integration into the target system.
-   **Send Acknowledgment (Ack) Back**: Both import and export jobs have Ack.
    -   **For an Import Job**: An acknowledgment (Ack) is generated to confirm receipt of the data and communicate the outcome of processing back to the source system.
    -   **For Export Jobs**: The external system generates an Ack to confirm receipt of the data and communicate with us.

|--------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             **Supplier Import**      |             NA    |             Import supplier master data. | In many cases, the supplier master is maintained in the financial system. A client using EAM requisitions, purchasing, and/or invoice matching modules will need a copy of the supplier master stored in the system. The Supplier Interface automates the process of adding or updating suppliers in the financial system and making corresponding changes in the EAM system. |
|       **Work Order Standard Import** |        NA         |        Import new WO.                    | The task involves importing new work orders into EAM from an external system. Upon creation, an acknowledgment is sent to the external system. The integration supports creating work orders based on alarms, existing standard requests or master plans, or information provided in a file. Tasks and subtasks from associated standard requests or master plans are copied, along with various information such as resources, requisitions, and instructions.|
|               **Inventory Import**                            |                NA |               Import item master data. | The task involves importing item master data into EAM from an ERP/MES/MDM/External system. It ensures quantity adjustments are reflected in EAM for inventory issued or returned, either associated with work orders or permanent items. Transactions are interfaced with EAM, updating requisitions and quantities on hand. Price or other item information updates for permanent items can also be sent to EAM, affecting subsequent issues and returns.  |
|        **MeterReading Import**                                |         NA     |        Import existing meter readings           | Integrate meter readings into EAM to trigger PM generation based on meter reading thresholds. Readings from PLC or other tracking systems are imported into EAM and associated with equipment identifiers. XML file format is used for reading imports.                                                                                                           |
|            **WorkOrder Alarm Import**                         |             NA |            Create a new WO using the Alarm code | This integration enables the creation of work orders in EAM based on alarm codes from an equipment monitoring system. A designated standard request or master plan serves as the basis for the work order, with associated tasks and subtasks copied as needed. EAM sends an acknowledgment to the external system upon creation, preventing duplicate work order submissions. |
|                     **Inventory IssueReturn Import**          |                      NA |                   Import Issue/Return/adjust inventory transaction from an external system | This integration facilitates the issue and return of MRO inventory in the ERP system, which is interfaced with EAM to ensure accurate inventory tracking and cost posting to associated work orders. Inventory issues and returns not associated with an EAM work order won't be sent to EAM. On the other hand, inventory issues and returns associated with an EAM work order will be interfaced with EAM. Permanent item replenishment and price updates are managed in the ERP, with EAM quantities and costs updated accordingly. The update of the cost on the item will not affect any historical data, but it will be the cost used for any subsequent issues/returns for the items in EAM. |
|              **Purchase Order**                               | This integration facilitates the transfer of purchase orders and, optionally, receipts from a customer's ERP application to EAM. It ensures that work order costs and inventory quantities are updated in EAM, with two steps executed: loading XML files into the EAM purchasing interface table and updating EAM with ERP information.                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                       |

-   GL Extract Ack Import and GL Extract with Ack are interconnected jobs designed to facilitate efficient data exchange between systems.
-   The GL Extract No Ack job operates independently. If customers choose not to provide acknowledgment, only the GL Extract No Ack job will be visible in their UI.
-   However, if they agree to provide acknowledgment, then GL Extract Ack Import and GL Extract with Ack will be visible in their UI. Customers can choose this option based on their integration preferences with EAM.

> [!Note]  
> This also applies to all other Export jobs mentioned below; based on the features
they have selected, specific internal jobs will be accessible in their user interface (UI). If
users choose acknowledgment, the Data Extract Acknowledgment Import and Data Extract
with Acknowledgment will be visible in their UI. If not, only Data Extract No Acknowledgment
will appear in their UI.

|     **Purchase Order Export**               | Extract purchase order information from EAM and interface it to your ERP system for invoice matching. The interface will extract the PO from EAM and transfer it to an XML file. Depending on the integration type the customer chooses, if acknowledgments cannot be sent, they will be considered processed. If acknowledgments are expected, the receiving system will return an acknowledgment of the receipt of the PO and identify any errors related to the integration. |  |

This ensures that the same records are not exported again in subsequent runs. The information about the date_transmitted and time\_ transmitted is then updated in the po\_ purchase_order_extract table to keep track of processed data and prevent duplication. </li></ul>|
