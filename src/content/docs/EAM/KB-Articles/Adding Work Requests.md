## Create WorkOrder Via EAM Mobile Requester

The Aptean EAM Mobile application is included with your EAM system and can be accessed from the desktop or downloaded from the Apple Store or Google Play Store.

Prior to entering a **WorkRequest** a user should be configured to use the mobile requester
application, assign the user to the Mobile Requester application group from the **Tenant portal**.
This will assign a Requester license and a Mobile Requester security group to the user in **EAM
Security** as shown below.
