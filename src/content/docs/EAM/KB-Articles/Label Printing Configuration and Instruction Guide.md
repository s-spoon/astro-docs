    ```computerName: **APT05-XXXXXXX**  
    commands:  
    -name: LabelPrinter  
    command: C:\Program 
    Files\Aptean\EAMLabelPrintIntegration\EAMLabelPrintIntegration.exe  
    working-dir: **c:\tmp**  
    arguments: [ "--file", "$(FILENAME)" ] 
    drop-dir: **c:\tmp**  
    delete-file: **false**  
    -name: Local Drop  
    drop-dir: **C:\tmp\tmp  **
 

Just copy above information to the file and update the values in bold (no need to change
other config information).

original one.
