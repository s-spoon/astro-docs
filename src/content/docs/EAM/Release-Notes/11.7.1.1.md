## Resolved Issues

The issues that were addressed in this release are listed in the following
table:

Bug ID/ Case ID |  Module |  Description  
---|---|---  
565609 |  EAM Mobile |  Security groups for Mobile Requester, Mobile Technician, Mobile Stores, and Mobile Approver are made available by default.   
567908 |  EAM Mobile |  Issues related to the approvals process are resolved. The Approve, Review, and Reject buttons are functional, as is the selection of Next Reviewer and Assigned To.   
569114 |  Work Order |  The bin name has been added to the Returns screen for work orders so that the appropriate bin for the return can be selected when the store location contains multiple bins. Previously, the part would be returned directly to the Primary bin.  
569621 |  Equipment |  Two corrections were made in the PM Schedule card of the Details contextual panel that can be opened from the Equipment Search. The master plan number is now formatted as a hyperlink so that the master plan can be opened directly. Additionally, modifications were made to allow the proper functioning of the pop-out icon on the card.
