## Features

This release introduces several customer-driven enhancements to improve the functionality and usability of EAM. Key updates include the ability to upload and display images for employees and equipment, similar to **Inventory**, and the option for privileged users to **Undelete Equipment** marked as deleted. Additionally, Multiple Purchase Orders (POs) can now be processed under a single invoice, allowing seamless handling of taxes, freight, and credits.

Enhancements to **Cycle Count** entry now ensure independent and item-specific processing. The ability to upload plant-level logos for printing on **Purchase Orders** and **RFQs** provides greater flexibility in branding. A new Import button for **Purchase Orders** and **RFQs** **Texts** allows users to easily import text from their local drive.

Security management has also been enhanced to support mass updates, enabling administrators to efficiently assign users to Security groups or apply group updates in bulk. Other improvements include support for negative quantities in POs, multiple RFQ forwarding, and an option to suppress timezone difference pop-ups for a smoother user experience.

| 545906 | Tenant Portal | Tenant Portal - Home Page: A new option has been added which allows the user to pin a favorite database and plant selection for log-in. When pinned, that database and plant combination will be selected by default when the home page is opened. If no favorite is pinned and the user has multiple databases or plants available, the selections made during the last log-in will be set by default. For users with only one database and plant combination, those values will also be set automatically by default. |

| 565612            | Work Order             | Inspection Reports are no longer added to assets (equipment and serial), as this was causing the same inspection report to appear twice in the work order linked documents - once for the asset, and once for the work order. Inspection Reports for equipment or serial can be viewed via by opening the Inspection Results contextual panel and choosing the View PDF option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 573411            | Inventory              | In the module search screens, a favorite query can be pinned that will subsequently be selected by default when the module search screen opens. This feature has now been extended to pop-up module search screens. For example, the favorite query pinned in the Item Search will be selected by default when the Item Search pop-up is opened by selecting the search icon in an Item field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 577858            | Invoice                | The out of balance error condition will no longer be displayed when saving an invoice voucher line. Following this change, the out of balance error will be displayed only after the control total has been entered on the Totals tab and the proper conditions are met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 586425            | Buyer's Backlog        | In the Ready for Purchase queue of the Buyers Backlog, the Transfer Purchase Order action has been modified so that the transfer of an RFQ line having no originating requisition line is a valid condition. Previously, the application would fail to respond when attempting to transfer an RFQ line with no requisition line to an existing purchase order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 588359            | Work Order             | The Work Order Issues screen has been updated such that the "Unissued Items" filter is automatically removed after an Issue action is performed. The removal of this filter allows the user to view the issue just performed, including any error that may have been encountered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 596552            | Purchase Order         | The Xrecp transaction for PO Receipts has been modified such that the transaction will fail and provide an informational message to the user if the employee ID used for the receipt does not exist or is inactive. This change provides consistency with logic already in place for other types of Stores Activity transactions, such as Issue and Return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

In an effort to make these conditions more transparent to the user, these criteria have been moved directly to the Criteria tab in Query Setup for the queries in these modules.They will be available by default when creating new queries, but can be edited or removed in query setup; therefore, it will be possible for requisition lines not meeting the proper conditions to appear in the search results. However, any line not meeting the conditions for the selected action will not be processed, and an error message will display alerting the user to the failed condition. |
