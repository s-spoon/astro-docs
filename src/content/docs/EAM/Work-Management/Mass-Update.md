  3. Click **Mass Update** from the actions Center.
  4. The **Mass Update** window appears. You can click on to view the information.
  5. Select the check box and enter the values for the fields to be updated. 

After updating the fields, click **Save** and a confirmation message or error toast messages is displayed accordingly. You can click **Clear All** to remove all
updated values.

You can click on the toast message to view Work Order, Description, Status,
Result, Failure/Error = and Result
Message details in a separate tab (**Mass Update Report**).
