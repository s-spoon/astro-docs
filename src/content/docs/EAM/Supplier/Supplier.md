The Supplier module contains basic supplier information. When looking for
information about a particular supplier, you can use the **Supplier Search**
window to search the database. Based on the selection criteria provided, the
Aptean EAM displays a list of suppliers. The **Supplier Module** displays
information about one or more selected suppliers.

You enter information about new and existing suppliers in the Supplier module.
Other Aptean EAM modules use this information to create work orders, perform
scheduling activities, and track equipment resources. It is very important
that you enter the information correctly and completely, using the tools
provided in the Suppliers module.

The two main tools are the **Supplier Search** and **Supplier Module**.
Learning to use these tools will help you to understand supplier module more
efficiently.
