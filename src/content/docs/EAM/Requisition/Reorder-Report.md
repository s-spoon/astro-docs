  2. The **Reorder Report** window opens. You can click on **X** to close the window.
  
  3. Enter the from and to dates in the user defined format. You can select the **From Date** and **Thru** using the **Calendar** also. 
  4. In the **Stores Location** field, select a value from the drop-down. All the locations that user got access are displayed in the drop down.
  5. Click **OK**. If there are no requisitions, it displays a message. Otherwise, it will print the report.
