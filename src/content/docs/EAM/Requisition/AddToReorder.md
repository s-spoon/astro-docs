When creating an Add to Reorder requisition, the system assigns a requisition
number consisting of the constant MO plus a number generated from today's
date. The date portion of the number uses the format YYYYMMDD. For example, a
reorder requisition created on January 16, 2011, generates MO20110116 as the
requisition number.

Values entered in the % (percentage) field must total 100. Enter a decimal
point as appropriate to separate whole percentages from decimal values; e.g.,
“25.5%.”
