The Requisition module allows you to enter requests for goods and services.
The work order module allows you to plan the resources needed and
simultaneously create a requisition. The requisition then needs to be sent for
review and approval. After approval, the process of deciding the source of
supply, making delivery at the time and place requested begins. The source of
supply can be an internal storeroom or an outside supplier. Also, costs can be
spread over several accounts for each line on the requisition.

This section will help guide you through using the Requisition Module. It
includes the following sections:

  1. The Requisition Search window enables you to select requisition records based on any combination of conditions for data elements found in the Requisitions table. The results can be displayed on the screen, printed, or selected for further processing. 

  2. **Creating a Requisition** : allows you to create requisition.

  3. Using the Reorder Report: allows you to generate a reorder report for a date range.
