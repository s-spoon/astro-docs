Using the Invoice Matching Search, you can search for the supplier invoices
based on the Voucher #, Purchase Order, and Supplier. If you leave the Voucher
#, Purchase Order, and Supplier fields empty, the search results will depend
on the selected query.

To perform an invoice matching search, follow these steps:

  1. Select a Query from the drop-down list and click Search. This will display all the supplier invoices for the selected query.

  2. To search for a specific supplier invoice, do the following:
    
      1. Enter the Voucher #, Purchase Order, or Supplier in their respective fields. The value you enter will be added to the selection criteria defined by the selected query.

          The more data you enter, the narrower the resulting search will be.

      2. Click Search.

          The system will then display a list of supplier invoices that match the selection criteria
