The invoice module enables the users, to enhance the invoicing process by
providing efficient invoice search and voucher creation capabilities. The
invoice module allows the users to create vouchers to accurately track and
manage supplier invoices. Depending on the type of invoice, you can create
three different types of vouchers:

**Purchase Order Invoice** : This voucher type is specifically designed for
invoices that are associated with a purchase order. By creating a Purchase
Order Invoice voucher, you can effectively match and reconcile invoices
against the corresponding purchase orders, streamlining the verification
process.

**Direct Charge Invoice** : For invoices that are not linked to a purchase
order, the Direct Charge Invoice voucher can be created. This type of voucher
allows you to record and track invoices directly related to specific expenses
or services, providing transparency and control over direct charges.

**Credit Memo** : The Credit Memo voucher is designed to handle invoice
adjustments or credits. By creating a Credit Memo voucher, you can accurately
reflect any modifications or made to invoices, ensuring accurate accounting
and financial records.
