information in EAM.

  1. To publish, Navigate to **Calendar/Work order** search panel.

  2. Click the **Publish** button.

  3. Publishing can be of two types:

     * **Craft Publish** occurs when the assigned date for a work order is set before the current date, and it updates the work order status.

     * **Employee Publish** occurs when the assigned date is set for the current date or after, updating the status of work order and assigning the work order to employees.

>[!NOTE]
>An alert prompt triggers when a published work order lacks approval, has
insufficient items, or lacks delivery information. In the case of multiple
publishing attempts, the work order shows a 'no result' message, accompanied
by a green tick.

>*When the Craft Schedule and Employee Assignments are completed, the Publish task will update the appropriate Work Orders with status, employee assignment(s), and work order scheduled date.*
