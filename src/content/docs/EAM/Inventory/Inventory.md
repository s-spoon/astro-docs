The Inventory module provides tracking of MRO inventory, including multiple plant and multiple storeroom environments. This module maintains cost and transaction history, and can generate reports on inventory valuation, balances, and usage levels to determine the optimum stocking levels for your operation. Stock, non-stock, and repairable items are effectively managed with this module.

You enter information about new and existing item in the Item module. Other Aptean EAM modules use this information to create work orders, perform scheduling activities, and track equipment resources. It is very important that you enter the information correctly and completely, using the tools provided in the Inventory module.
