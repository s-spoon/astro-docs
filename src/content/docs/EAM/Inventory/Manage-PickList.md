Using the **Manage PickList**, you can search for and display records related to the picklists. Menupath: **Inventory \> Manage PickList**

The Manage PickList search window allows you to search by picklist. If you do not enter a value in the PickList, Requester and Work Order , the search uses only the selection criteria of the selected query.

To perform a search:

1.  Select a **Query** from the drop-down list and click **Search**.  
    It displays all the picklists for the selected query.

2.  To search for a specific picklist, perform the following:
    -   Enter a full or partial value in the **PickList**, **Requester** or **Work Order** fields. The value you enter becomes an add-on to the selection criteria built into the selected query. The more complete the description entered, the narrower the resulting search will be.
    -   Click **Search**.

It displays a list of picklists matching the selection criteria. See Generic Components and Troubleshooting also.

## PickList Search Screen Grid

In the picklist search screen, a list of picklists matching the selection criteria will be displayed in grid. See Grid Operations also.
