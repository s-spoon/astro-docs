title: "Events"
draft: false

---
The Events module has been added to Aptean EAM, which allows the user to query, report, and view system generated events such as work order events and serial installations.

You can also define own event types, create user defined fields for each event type to track specific data points, attach documents, execute a workflow for the event, and optionally associate the event with an asset.

This feature helps you to document, track, and report on (via the Query Wizard or Analytics) any organizational task or workflow. Other key features in module are tracking safety events, environmental events, audit findings and any needed follow up, capturing shift notes, and accepting data feeds from 3rd party systems for visibility or analysis.

From the Events Management module, you can create a new event, search for an event, delete an event, and export the details of the event.

## Create Event

Events are categorized into user defined event and system generated events.
You can create the user defined events manually, whereas the system events are automatically generated by the system when some specific actions occur.

To create a manual event,

  1. From the left Navigation pane, click **Events** and then click **Create Event** menu.
