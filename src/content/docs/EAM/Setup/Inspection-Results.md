  >[!Note]  
  >EAM inspection checklist forms and printed reports are highly configurable by
the user. Users can configure the Inspection collection items, format and validation of the collected data, ordering of collection items on the form, and required and failed rules. Tools and calibration instruments can optionally be configured for an Inspection. However, the printed inspection form is not customizable by the user beyond the flexibility in the form design, which is subsequently printed in the inspection report. For further customization needs, Aptean can customize the form as part of a Professional Services engagement.

 >[!Note]  
 >Once an inspection is performed, the report is attached as a document on to a Workorder.
