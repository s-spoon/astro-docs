The **Share** button in the action bar allows you to share a private query
with other users.

Perform the following procedure to share a query:

  1. In the [Query Wizard](Query-Wizard.md) page, select the required query and click **Share** on the action bar.

      The **Share Private Query-** window opens with **User Id** and **Name** columns.

  1. Search the user by using the **Filter** field. 
  2. Select the **User ID** and click **Share Query**.

      A notification **Shared Query: Query Name** appears.

  3. For the user with which the query was shared, they will see the query name as **\<Old Query Name - userid\>**.

      In case of any error, an Alert prompt opens, for more information, see Alert.

     >[!Note] 
     >You can share only the **private** queries as public queries are visible to
assigned user group.
