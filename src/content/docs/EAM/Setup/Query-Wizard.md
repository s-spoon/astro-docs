To perform day-to-day duties, you need to find and display information pertinent to their particular job responsibilities. Rather than use standard reports designed for the general population, you can take advantage of
Aptean EAMâ€™s query function. Guided by online instruction, you can create his or her own private query, or a public query if he or she has access rights to do this. For more information on security query capabilities, see [Security Queries](Security-and-Settings-for-Query-Wizard.md) in Aptean
EAM Setup.

The Query Wizard function in Aptean EAM allows you to add and edit queries.
The queries help you find and display specific information for a module in Aptean EAM. For example, the query **Approved WO** displays only approved work orders.

To access the Query Wizard module in Aptean EAM, in the main menu sidebar, open **Setup** and click **Query Wizard**.

In any of the search windows in a module (Work orders, PM, Requisitions, and so on), select a query from the query drop-down list to display the results of the query.

You can create their own private query, or a public query if they have the access.

**Private Query** : You create queries for yourself and access them when required. These queries cannot be accessed by others unless the system administrator provides access to them.

**Public Query** : The queries are created by other users that are made available to selected users by the system administrator.

By following the instructions, the wizard steps you through a series of
windows to construct the query. The steps covered in the process include:

  * Naming the query and deciding on the query type - private or public. 
  * Choosing data elements and deciding on the format for display. 
  * Deciding how the information is grouped and what totals to display. 
  * Deciding how the information is sorted. 
  * Choosing selection criteria for certain elements and defining conditions for their display. 

The query wizard will be available for the following modules. From the Module drop-down menu, you can select the module to create a query.

  * All Backlogs

  * Cycle Count

  * Ecatalog Errors

  * Employee
