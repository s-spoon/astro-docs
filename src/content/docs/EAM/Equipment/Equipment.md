A companyâ€™s ability to manage equipment efficiently saves time and money and
Aptean EAM is designed to manage these equipment resources. In Aptean EAM
terms, equipment can be whatever your company needs it to be to effectively
manage your operation, including a large piece of process equipment, a pump,
office equipment, or a location.

You enter information about new and existing equipment in the Equipment
module. Other Aptean EAM modules use this information to create work orders,
perform scheduling activities, and track equipment resources. It is very
important that you enter the information correctly and completely, using the
tools provided in the Equipment module. The four main tools are the
**Equipment Search** , the **Equipment Module** , the **Serial Search** , the
**Serial Number Module** , and the **Equipment Hierarchy**. Learning to use
these tools will help you manage your equipment more efficiently.

This topic explains how to use the Equipment module to manage facility and
plant equipment. Procedures covered include:
