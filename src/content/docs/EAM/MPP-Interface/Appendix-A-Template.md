## Template

A best practice to avoid re-work is to create a Microsoft Project template. You can use this template for all new EAM projects and avoid adding and re- arranging columns each time you start a new project.

Perform the following procedure to create a Microsoft Project template:

  1. Open a new empty project in Microsoft Project. For more information, see [Create an Empty Project](MPPI-Create-an-Empty-Project.md).
  2. Add the required columns and re-arrange the columns in the required order.
  3. Save the changes and then click **File > Save As** to save this project with a name, for example, **\<Name\>Template** in a location of your choice. 

To use the saved **\<Name\> Template** when you download a new EAM schedule into a Microsoft Project, perform the following procedure:

  1. Open an empty project file in Microsoft Project. 
  2. Click **File > Open** to browse and open the **\<Name\>Template.**

      The template opens.

  3. Next, click **File > Save As** to save a copy of the **\<Name\>Template** with a name of your choice and ensure that the file type is **.mpp** , for example, **\<Name\>.mpp**.

  4. Next, either continue working on the **\<Name\>.mpp** file or close the file and later open the newly saved **\<Name\>.mpp** file, log in with your EAM user credentials and start working on the Work Orders.
