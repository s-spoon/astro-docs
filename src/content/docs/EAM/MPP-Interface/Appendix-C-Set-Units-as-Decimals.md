#### Set Units as Decimals

The Microsoft Project displays units as a percentage in the **Units** field by default. However, you can set this field to show values in decimals rather than as a percentage.

To set the value of the Units field in decimals:

  1. Open the Microsoft Project and go to **File > Options**.

      The **Project Options** window opens.

  2. Click **Schedule**.

      The **Change options related to scheduling, calendars, and calculations** page opens.

  3. In the **Schedule** section, modify the value for the **Show Assignment Units As** field from the drop-down as required, and then click **OK**.
