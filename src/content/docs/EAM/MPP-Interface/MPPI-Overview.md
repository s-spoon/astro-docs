EAM provides an interface to the Microsoft Project Plan (MPP), also called as Microsoft Project or Project in this help file. This interface allows you to transfer information about work orders maintained in EAM comprising planned labor, other planned costs, and so on into Microsoft Project for detailed planning and analysis. Once the work orders are updated in the Project file,
the updated data is synchronized with the EAM Database.

The EAM interface is a desktop based application and uses a plug-in to interact with the EAM Database. The plug-in allows information to flow both ways between EAM Database and Microsoft Project. The shared data is updated or added either through EAM or Microsoft Project.

>[!Note]: You must install the plug-in to start a EAM Microsoft Project. Once the installation is complete, the **EAM Scheduling** tab is displayed on the Microsoft Project file.
