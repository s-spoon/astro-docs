#### Calendar Options

The Microsoft Project allows you to set the work hours per day in its calendar options. Before working on the work orders, the schedulers can use the calendar options to set the work hours per day as required.

  >[!Note]: This setting is optional, and cannot be synchronized with EAM.

**To set the work hours per day:**

  1. Open the Microsoft Project and go to **File > Options**.

      The **Project Options** window opens.

  2. Click **Schedule**.

      The **Change options related to scheduling, calendars, and calculations** page
opens.

  3. In the **Calendar options for this project** section, modify the value for the **Hours per day** field from the drop-down as required, and then click **OK**.
