After importing the data from EAM to your Project file, you can edit, add, or delete the data in the sheet.

After updating the work orders in the Project sheet, you need to upload the updated data back to the work orders in EAM Database. For more information, see [Synchronizing Data](MPPI-Synchronizing-Data.md).
