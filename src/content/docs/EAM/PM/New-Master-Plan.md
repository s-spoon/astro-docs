A Master Plan is a set of records that describes the resources and steps
required to perform a PM inspection. A Master Plan is permanent that can be
reused and can be applied to multiple equipment items of the same make and
model.

## Creating a New Master Plan

The New Master Plan is created the same way a New Work Order is created.

To create a New Master Plan, you can perform the following:

  1. Click **New Master Plan** under the **PM Schedules** menu. **Create New Work Order** page opens.
  2. The **Work Order Type** field will be populated with **PM - Master Plan.**  
Following two tabs will be displayed:

     * **Standard Requests** : It displays all the work orders in a grid. If the Equipment is selected, the work orders would be grouped by the equipment or else it would display the complete list of Standard requests for all equipment and the user can group by Equipment Class. 
     * **Open Work Orders** : It displays all the open work orders in grid for the equipment selected by user.  
You can filter the required value using **Filter Results** field on top right
corner in the grids. See Grid Operations also.

  4. In the **Equipment** field, enter the equipment ID or click **Search** icon to select the equipment ID.
  5. Enter the work order number if required in **Work Order Number** field. 
  6. Click **Next**.
  7. **Create Work Order** window opens. You must fill the required fields in **Work Order** tab and click on **Create** to create the new master plan. The new PM work order number will be generated and Master plan note book page opens. See Master Plan Module for more details.
