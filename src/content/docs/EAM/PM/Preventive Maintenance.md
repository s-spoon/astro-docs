A PM (preventive maintenance) Schedule section provides an organized approach
to inspecting equipment on a planned, periodic basis. The purpose of the PM
program is to uncover conditions that can lead to equipment failure or can
shorten the life of the equipment.

The PM program includes the upkeep required to avoid such conditions or
correct them while they are still minor. Upkeep includes adjustments,
calibrations, lubrication, and minor repairs needed to prevent conditions that
may lead to major failures.

Developing and activating a PM program includes:

  * Identifying the critical items of equipment to be included in the PM program. 
  * Reviewing the manufacturer's guide to determine the recommended procedures and intervals for service. 
  * Developing inspection plans that define the resources required and describe the detailed steps to follow for completing an inspection. 
  * Determining the inception frequencies and the approximate date of the first inspection and entering this data for equipment by **Location**.
