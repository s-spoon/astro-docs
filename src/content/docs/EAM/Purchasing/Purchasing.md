The Purchasing module contains fundamental purchasing information. To find information about a particular purchase order, use the **Purchase Order Search** window to search the records. Based on the selection criteria that you provide, the Aptean EAM displays a list of purchase orders. The **Purchase Order Module** displays information about one or more selected purchase orders, with each purchase order being associated with a specific supplier.

You enter information about new and existing purchase orders in the **Purchase Order Search** window. Make sure that you enter the appropriate information correctly and completely, using the tools provided in the Purchasing module.

The two main tools are the **Purchase Order Search** and **Purchase Order Module**. Learning to use these tools will help you to understand the Purchasing module more efficiently.

In addition to creating a purchase order, you can create a change order, blanket order, service contract purchase order, and released from blanket order. The Change Order option allows you to update the details of an existing purchase order. The Blanket order is a contract created between the customer and the supplier with the list of items agreed to purchase, pricing, and the contract expiry date. The service contract purchase order allows the users to add the service contract items on the purchase orders.

You can create the service contract purchase order on regular purchase order and blanket order. Other key features added to the purchase order module are protecting the supplier on PO and blanket change orders, auto issue of orders, and change of currency with respect to the supplier location.
