The Change Order option allows the user to update the details of an existing purchase order.

To create a change order, perform the following steps:

    On entering the purchase order, the application populated the purchase orders matching the entered text. Select the required purchase order.
    >[!NOTE]
    > The last 3 digits of the purchase order denotes the number of revision/change
    order. For example, if the Purchase order is ERP-000-000, then it is the original
    purchase order. If it is 001 then it denotes that the PO is at change order 001.

4.  Click **NEXT**.

    The PO lines available for the purchase order appears.

5.  Select the line in which you want to make a change and click **NEXT**.
6.  The details of the purchase order appear. You can change the details that are open for edit.
