Access Management allows administrators to create, edit, delete, and manage groups, while also implementing role-based access control (RBAC) that controls permissions for product access, feature access, and authorization during creation of a group.

Access Management consists of two tabs **Groups** and **Users**.
-   [Groups](groups.md)
-   [Users](users.md)
