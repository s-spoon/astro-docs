You can view details of pending invoices and your payment history. Admins or users with invoice permissions can access all historical invoices, outstanding invoices that require payment. 

The invoice list is generated from the financial transactions associated with your account and displays key information, including transaction types, creation dates, due dates, amounts paid, and remaining balances.

For billing inquiries, contact the Aptean team by clicking **Contact** on the **Open Invoice** or **Payment History** tab. This action will open a blank email in your default email client, enabling you to send your questions directly to the appropriate department.
