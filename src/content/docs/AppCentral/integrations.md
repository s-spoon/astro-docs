Integrations refer to the methods and strategies used to connect different software applications and systems, enabling them to work together effectively. This is essential for optimizing operations, enhancing data exchange, and improving overall efficiency in business workflows. <br>Aptean AppCentral facilitates the integration of Made2Manage (M2M) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) with various applications, including Aptean Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Aptean Ship, and Aptean Enterprise Asset Management (EAM).

Primary Features of Integrations:

-   **Data Exchange**: Integrations facilitate the transfer of data between applications, minimizing the need for duplicate data entry. This can include one-way transfers from M2M to CRM, one-way transfers from CRM to M2M, or two-way exchanges between both systems.
-   **Real-Time Updates**: Integrated system provides real-time updates, ensuring that all applications display the latest data. For example, for integrated applications, if you add a contact in M2M, the same contact is accessible in CRM.
-   **Event Publishing**: Applications can send events to AppCentral when specific actions occur, such as adding a new company. <Br> For instance, when you add a new user in AppCentral, you can view this logged event in **User Center > Activities & Audit > Integration Events**. If the event fails, you can report the issue by creating a case: navigate to **My Solution > Connect > Support Cases > Create New Case**.
