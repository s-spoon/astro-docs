In the **IAM** tab, you can set up Mobile Authenticator to enhance login security. Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) strengthens your account protection by requiring both your regular password and a one-time password (OTP) during login. This two-step verification process combines something you know with something you have, offering an added layer of security.

To set up IAM, perform the following:
1.	Install one of the following applications on your mobile device:
    -   Google Authenticator
    -   FreeOTP
    -   Microsoft Authenticator
2.	Open the application, scan the barcode, or enter the key displayed on the setup page.
3.	Enter the one-time code provided by the application and click Submit to complete the setup. Provide a device name to help manage your OTP devices.
