The **Sync All Users** option allows you to automatic synchronization of newly added users in Aptean AppCentral to the activated products. This process ensures that user information, permissions, user group, and other relevant details are consistently updated across the associated products. 

To synchronize all the newly added users in Aptean AppCentral, perform the following steps:

1.  On the **Users** tab, click **Sync All Users**.

2.  Click **OK**.  
    A notification appears that “The user sync has started, it will take 5-10 minutes for the users to update in each of the applications” on the window.
