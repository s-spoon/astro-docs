Use the **Folder Access Information (CSFLACINF)** page to specify the account details of the Made2Manage (M2M) core service sign in account that must be given the permission to access the Made2Manage SysPath.

To add SysPath folder access information



1. Specify the account details of the M2M core service sign in account for which you want to grant access to the Made2Manage SysPath:

    1. In the **Username** field, type the user name of the service sign in account.

    2. In the **Password** field, type the password used to sign in to the service.

    3. In the **Domain** field, type the domain name of the user account used to sign in to the service.

        >[!INOTE]Only the **Password** field is case-sensitive. The values entered in the **Username** and **Domain** fields are not case-sensitive.

2. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**.

    If you specify correct account details, the details are saved. Else, Made2Manage displays an error message.

    A service instance that uses a domain user account requires periodic administrative action to maintain the account password.
