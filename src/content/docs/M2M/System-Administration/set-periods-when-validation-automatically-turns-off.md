During times of system maintenance, barcode cannot reliably validate input and might regard valid input as invalid. To avoid this, set times to turn automatic validation off that coincide with regular system maintenance.

If you change your validation "**off**" periods for barcode collection, you may also need to set "**off**" periods for barcode posting.

To set validation off periods in Aptean Made2Manage ERP, follow these steps:

1. Launch Made2Manage:  
   - Open **Made2Manage** from the App Central, and choose **Bar Code Posting Setup**.  
   - Navigate to the **Setup** tab.  

2. Access Posting 'Off' Periods:  
   - Go to the **Posting 'Off' Periods** tab and click **Edit**.  

3. Add a Period:  
   - Click **Add Posting 'Off' Period**.  
   - Enter the period's start and end times in the **Off Time** and **On Time** fields using military time (e.g., 3:15 p.m. is 15:15, and midnight is 0:00).  
   - Check the box next to each day you want to include.  

4. Change a Period:  
   - Select the existing period you want to modify, then make your adjustments.  

5. Remove a Period:  
   - Highlight the period you want to remove and click the **Delete Posting 'Off' Period** button.  

6. Save Your Changes:  
   - Click **Done** to save your settings.  

If you are setting up barcode collections for the first time and have **TT5a, TT5b, TT6a, or TT6b** devices, proceed to configure their relay options next.
