Use the **Made2Manage Report Wizard (RPWIZ)** to select the tables and specify the join criteria. This creates the report query, which you can view in the **Expression** area.

The tables and views are fetched from the M2MDataXX database on the SQL server and are displayed in different tabs. The description is fetched from the **UTTABLE** table in the M2MSystem database.

### To specify the table join criteria using the Made2Manage Report Wizard

1. Select the tables or views:

    1.  Click the **Tables** tab / the **Views** tab.
    2.  Select the required table / view.

        >[!TIP]Type the table / view name in the blank row of the **Name** column to search for that table.

    3.  Double-click it or drag and drop to the **Selected Tables** area.
    4.  In the **Alias** column, specify an alias, if required.
    5.  In the **Selected Tables** area, select the **Is Primary** check box if the table / view is the Left Table in the join.
