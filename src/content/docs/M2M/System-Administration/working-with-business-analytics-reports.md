Business Analytics contains predefined reports. You can use the output of these reports "as is", change the criteria included in the reports, modify the layout of the reports and optionally save the modification, use them as a basis for new reports.

Business Analytics reports run in Microsoft Excel , so you must have Excel 2000 or higher.

What are the predefined Business Analytics reports?

### Printing

You generate a Business Analytics report the same way that you generate other Made2Manage reports. The only differences are:

- BA reports have an Excel template**Layout**.

- When you click the **Run Now** , Excel loads, and the data displays on tabs in the spreadsheet.

- From Excel, you can print the report to a printer, further filter the information included in the report, and/or save the worksheet or report template for future use.

### Changing report criteria

Information is included in **Business Analytics reports** based on the criteria that you enter on the **Report Parameters** window. However, it is possible to change that criteria once the report is generated and displays in Excel.

Some Field's display with an arrow indicates that you can further filter the information included in that field. For example, if a report includes data by quarter, you could click the down arrow to change the quarters that are included. When you change the Field settings, the report data will display based on the new setting.

### Saving the Excel output

When you close a **Business Analytics report** in **Excel**, a message displays asking if you want to save the changes you made.

This message displays even if you did not change anything.

- Answer **Yes** to close Excel and save the report layout to the **Temp** folder with the name that it was assigned by the system.

    To save the report to the location/name you select, click on the **File**menu and select **Save As**.

- Answer **No** to close Excel without saving the report data.
