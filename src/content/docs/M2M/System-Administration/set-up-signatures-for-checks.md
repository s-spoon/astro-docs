You can set up a signature for each Made2Manage company to use when you print checks.

To set up a check signature

1. Create a signature with any third-party software that uses Windows Bitmap **(.bmp)** format.

You may want to test print the bitmap signature outside of Made2Manage to check the printed size of the bitmap against the signature output area on your blank checks. Resize the bitmap file accordingly before you use it in Made2Manage.

2. Name the signature file sign.bmp

3. Copy the signature file in your company data directory, which is a **Dataxx** subdirectory of the **M2MData** directory.

For example, if your data is stored on drive H, you would copy the signature for **Company1** to: **H:\m2mdata\data01\sign.bmp**
