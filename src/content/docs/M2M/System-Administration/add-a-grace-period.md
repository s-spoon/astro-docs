You can set grace periods for activities that you enter using barcode. For example, to allow employees to clock-in when they arrive but pay them only from the beginning of their 7:30 shift, set a grace period that shows all clock-in's between 7:15 and 7:35 as happening at 7:30.

You can set grace periods for the company, any department, or any employee.

The grace period entered for an employee overrides the grace periods assigned for the department or company. The grace period entered for a department overrides the grace periods assigned for the company.

For more information about barcode, see the **Related Information**.
