After you add a company, you can configure the company information.

To configure company information

1. Open the **Company Information (COMP)** page.

    1. Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Company** Information.

    Or

    2. Search for **COMP** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Company Information**

    **Company Information (COMP)** page appears.

2. Change the name, address, or contact information in the appropriate fields.

3. Select the **Allow Mixed Case Character Entry** check box, to allow users to enter data in mixed case.

    When you clear this check box, users can type information in uppercase only, except in memo fields, which always allow mixed case. Made2Manage is case-sensitive; searching for "job" does not return "JOB." To prevent confusion, clear this check box.

The **Lookup For Company Time Zone** window appears.

5. Select the row that contains the required Time Zone, and click **Select**.

    - **Functional**: To use the functional currency for all documents.

    - **Transactional**: To use the transactional currency for all documents.
