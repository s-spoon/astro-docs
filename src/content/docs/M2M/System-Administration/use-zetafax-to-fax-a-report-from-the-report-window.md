After you add fax commands to a report's layout, you can fax the report from the **Report Parameters Interface** window. You can use Zetafax to fax a report layout once, or you can set Zetafax as the default printer for that particular layout to fax the report layout regularly. You can also set Zetafax as the default printer for specific documents.

### To use Zetafax to fax a report from the report window

1. Open the report's **Report Parameters Interface** window.

    For example, to open the **Report Parameters Interface** window for the **Receiving Detail Report**, press **Alt+T**, type **RPREC**, and press **Enter**.

2. To fax a document once:

    - Click the **Copy** arrow and select which layout you want to fax.
