After you add distribution commands to a report's layout, you can e-mail the report from the **Report Parameters Interface** window. You can use Zetadocs to e-mail a report layout once, or you can set **Zetadocs** as the default printer for that particular layout to e-mail the report layout regularly. You can also set Zetadocs as the default printer for specific documents.

### To use Zetadocs to e-mail a report from the report window

1. Open the report's **Report Parameters Interface** window.

    For example, to open the **Report Parameters Interface** window for the **Receiving Detail Report**, press **Alt+T**, type **RPREC**, and press **Enter**.

2. To e-mail a document once:

    - Click the **Copy** arrow and select which layout you want to e-mail.

    - Click the **Printer Setup** .

        The **Select Printer** window opens.

    - Click on the **Destination Printer** arrow and select **Zetadocs PDF**.

    - Select the number of copies you want to email.

    - Click the **OK**.

3. To use **Zetadocs** to send more than one layout, or to make Zetadocs the default printer for specific layouts:

    - Click the **Copy** arrow and select **All Copies**.

    - Click the **Printer Setup**.

        The **Route Copies** window opens.

    - Under the **Destination Printer** area, click in the field next to each copy for which you want to set Zetadocs as the printer and select Zetadocs PDF.

    - To select **Zetadocs PDF** as the default printer for these layouts, check the **Save Choices** box.

        Or if you do not want to save **Zetadocs PDF** as the default printer, leave this box blank.

    - Click the **Close**.

4. In the **Output** area, click the **Print**.

5. Click the **Run Now**.
