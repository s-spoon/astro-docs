The barcode symbology you select determines how many characters your barcodes can use. The barcode devices supported by Made2Manage can use either of the following symbologies:

- Code 39 allows uppercase A–Z, digits 0–9, the hyphen (–), the space, \$, /, +, and %. Five bars and four spaces make up each character.

- Code 128 allows all 256 characters in the ASCII character set. Three bars and three spaces make up each character.

If you change the symbology, you must reprint all your barcodes.
