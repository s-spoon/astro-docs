You can set grace periods for activities that you enter using barcode. For example, to allow employees to clock-in when they arrive but pay them only from the beginning of their 7:30 shift, set a grace period that shows all clock-in's between 7:15 and 7:35 as happening at 7:30.

If you enter a grace period for an employee, the employee does not get any grace periods you assign for the department or company. If you enter a grace period for a department, the department does not get any grace periods you assign for the company. So if you assign an employee a special grace period but want the employee to receive the department and company grace periods, set those grace periods up for the employee too.

For more information about barcode, see the **Related Information**.
