You can set the barcode system to clock employees out during assigned break times. You can set automatic breaks for a company, a department, or an employee.

>[!IMPORTANT] To enable setting of automatic breaks, you must select the **Use Auto Breaks** check box in the **Settings** tab of the **Bar Code Posting Setup (BCSETUP)** page.

The breaks you enter for an employee override any breaks you assign for the department or company. The breaks you enter for a department override the breaks you assign for the company. So if you assign an employee a special break, but want the employee to receive the department and company breaks too, you must set those break times up for the employee.

If an employee manually clocks out during an automatic break, the employee does not receive the automatic break. If an employee manually clocks out during the final minute of an automatic break, or clocks in during the first minute of an automatic break, the employee does receive the automatic break.
