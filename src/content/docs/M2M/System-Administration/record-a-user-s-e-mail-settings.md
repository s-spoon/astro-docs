Before a user can use Report E-mailer to email reports to other users, you must save the user's email setup in Made2Manage.

To record email settings

1. Select the user.

2. In the **Email User Name** field, type the name the user uses to sign in to your electronic mail account.

    If a user needs to email reports to people outside of your company's network, type their full email address. For example, **user@company.com**. If not, type only the name that user uses to sign in to the account, such as **user**.

    f you use an SMTP email server, and use Events & Actions to send emails notifying users that an event has occurred, you must type the full email address. For example, **user@company.com**.

    If you use Microsoft Exchange email, and you do not need to email reports to people outside of your company’s network, you can type the name used to sign in to the user’s account. For example, **user**.

3. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to save the email settings.
