Groups in Made2Manage enable easy assignment of user permissions. You can group users based on some criteria such as their role or the department they work in.

Use the **Group Maintenance (GROUP)** page to create a new user group, change the parent group, or delete a group. For more information about managing groups, refer to Maintain user groups.

Made2Manage groups now follow a hierarchical structure. You can add a group to another group. The child group inherits the permissions of the parent group. However, you can modify the permissions of the child group. The **EVERYONE** group is at the root level. You cannot move this group to any other group. To specify a group as an independent group with no parent, add it under the **EVERYONE** group.

Use the **User Permission Wizard (PERMWIZ)** page to define the group hierarchy.
