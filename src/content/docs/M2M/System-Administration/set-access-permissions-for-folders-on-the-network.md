Permissions are rules associated with objects such as files and folders on a computer or on a network. Permissions determine whether you can access an object and what you can do with it.

For instance:

- If your application is trying to access a shared folder and fails to do so, then you might not have the required permissions. Check whether your user ID is available in the permission list.

- You might have access to a document on a shared folder on a network. And even though you can read the document, you might not have permissions to make changes to it.

- You are not able to view the company details or any related information.

- When you are trying to open a shared folder on the network you will receive an error message "Invalid folder".

- You do not have access to a particular file or any file or application on the network from your system.

All these could be due to lack of permissions.

Few to mention:
