You must add accounts for each user who will use Made2Manage. Do this from any workstation using an account that can open the **User Management (USER)** page.

To set up users

1. Add an Administrator user account.



2. Add each user:

    - Add the user's account.



    - Associate Made2Manage with other tools the user uses, so they can work together.



    - Set the user's e-mail preferences.



    You can also change settings (including passwords) for users who already have accounts and remove users who no longer use Made2Manage.



3\. Set permissions that control the pages each user can use.
