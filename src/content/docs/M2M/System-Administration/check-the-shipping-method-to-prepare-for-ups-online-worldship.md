As the final step in configuring Made2Manage to work with UPS OnLine WorldShip, check the shipping method you use in the **Ship Via** field on shippers.

When you export Made2Manage shipping information to UPS, Made2Manage exports only shippers that have a UPS shipping method. To ensure that Made2Manage exports the correct shippers, review entries in the **Ship Via** field and look for the character string "UPS".

### To check the shipping method

    1. Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Shipping** > **Shipping**.

    Or

    2. Search for **SHIP** or **Shipping** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Shipping**.

    **Shipping (SHIP)**  page appears.

2. Make your changes.

3. To check the shipping method:

    1. In the **Ship Via** list, click **Edit**.

        The **Popup Table Maintenance (POPUP)** window appears.

    2. If you want to export shipping information to UPS, check that the **Ship VIA entry** contains the character string "UPS" (in uppercase or lowercase anywhere in the **Description** field).

4. To change the shipping method:

    1. In the **Description** field, type your changes.

    2. On the header, click **Save** to keep your changes.

5. Repeat **Step 4** for each shipping method you want to change.

6. Click **Close** to exit from the **Popup Table Maintenance** window.

    After you check the shipping method, the next step is to export shipping information from Made2Manage to UPS OnLine WorldShip. See the **Related Information**.
