You can design the report query by selecting the **Designer Query Option** in the initial screen of the Made2Manage Report Wizard. This allows you to visually select the tables / views, and specify the join conditions.

You can also type your own query in the **Made2Manage Report Wizard (RPWIZ)** by selecting the **Editor Query Option** in the initial screen of the Made2Manage Report Wizard.

The **Data Preview** screen displays the first 100 results generated by your query. If you are satisfied, click **Next** to select the report fields. Else, click **Back** to modify your query.

For more information about obtaining help in the **Made2Manage Report Wizard (RPWIZ)** or navigating between the screens, refer to Getting help in Made2Manage Report Wizard.
