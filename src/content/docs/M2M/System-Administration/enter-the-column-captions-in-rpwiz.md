After you type your own query and click **Next**, the query is parsed and a schema is generated if the query is correct.

When you select the **Editor Query Option** in the initial screen of the Made2Manage Report Wizard, the information is not fetched from the Data Dictionary. The Made2Manage Report Wizard only reviews the actual database for the field names within the table. So, you must add your own captions and ensure that your report can be easily understood when it is rendered.

>[!IMPORTANT] To use a custom table, view, or field in the **Advanced Filter** for the new report, you must manually add an entry for the table, view, or field in the **Data Dictionary (DICT)** window before creating the report.

The schema grid contains three columns:

-   **Column**: Name of the column retrieved by the query
-   **Caption**: An editable field in which you can enter the caption.
-   **Type**: The data type of the column.

    In the **Caption** column of the schema grid, you can specify the captions for the columns retrieved by the query. These captions are used in the **Data Preview** and the **Report Preview** screens.

    Click **Next** to view the **Data Preview** screen. Else, click **Back** and modify your query.

For more information about obtaining help in the **Made2Manage Report Wizard (RPWIZ)** or navigating between the screens, refer to Getting help in Made2Manage Report Wizard.
