You can assign your own revision numbers to new or existing parts using the user-defined revision numbers feature. You can change user-defined revision numbers at any time in many Made2Manage pages. User-defined revision numbers are for informational purposes only and are not linked to previous revisions of a part.

After you turn on the user-defined revision numbers feature in Made2Manage, you cannot turn it off.

You can change parts with user-defined revision numbers without the additional steps required by Engineering Change Management (ECM). Because parts with user-defined revision numbers do not require you to use ECM, you do not create a revision history when changing parts with user-defined revision numbers. Instead, when you modify parts with user-defined revision numbers, Made2Manage creates a new record with no connection to any other part in the system.

You can use both user-defined revision numbers and engineering change management at the same time in Made2Manage. This lets you track revision history and maintain strict change control on ECM parts while not requiring such control on parts with user-defined revision numbers.

If you have existing parts that you would like to assign user-defined revision numbers or if you have existing parts with user-defined revision numbers that you would like to use standard revision numbers, you can do so using the **Revision Type Mass Change** (**INRTMC**) page.
