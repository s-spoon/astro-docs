Customers who have purchased Advanced Planning and/or Advanced Scheduling, and have the Synch server installed and running, can use the Made2Manage **CTP** functionality. Capable to Promise (CTP) is the amount of inventory or projected inventory not committed to sales orders for a specific date. Because Made2Manage uses the Planning and Scheduling, Advanced Scheduling and Planning modules, it can recognize the current load on work center capacity when it calculates CTP, so the amount is realistic.

CTP checks component availability down the supply chain. It also checks available raw materials, to determine if a particular product can be delivered by a specific date. A negative CTP quantity generally indicates unsupported customer demand.

CTP is only available after you activate it on the **CSSALE** page. You can then access the **CTP** page as follows:
