title: "Managing User Permissions for Engineering Change Control"
draft: false

User permissions are part of your system's security. You can manage users access to various pages and protect sensitive business data. For example, you can prevent salespeople from altering information in active item master's or changing engineering change orders (ECOs).

Users with permission to add, change, or remove information in the Item Master, Job Orders, or Sales Orders page can do so while these pages are in standard status. However, if an item is under ECM control, the user needs ECM permission to make changes once the part is active or obsolete.

Some users may need "override" permissions to:

-	Change an item even when it is under ECM control.
-	Modify information in an ECO even if it is not the original author.
<br>Only the system administrator has sufficient permissions to set user permissions.
