You can associate bills of material and outgoings with items on your quotations and sales orders. Either document can be casual or detailed. You can create casual bills of material and outgoings only for make items you do not keep in stock. You typically create casual bills of material and outgoings the first time you specify a part.

A casual bill of material loosely lists parts you need to produce a component, and loosely gathers material costs. A detailed bill of material precisely lists parts you need to produce a component, and precisely tracks material costs.

A casual routing loosely orders the operations you follow to produce a component, and approximates the production costs. A detailed routing precisely orders the operations you follow to produce a component and sums the production costs.
