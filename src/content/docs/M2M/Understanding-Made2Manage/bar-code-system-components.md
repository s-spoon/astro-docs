The bar code system consists primarily of three elements:

1.	The Wanding station.
2.	The Host Computer.
3.	Your Made2Manage computer network.

The Wanding Station, used to scan the bar code and collect information about parts, job orders, operations, can be wall-mounted or portable. For portable stations, a docking device is required to transfer the information you collected to the host computer. In contrast, a wall-mounted station sends information directly to the host computer. From the host computer, you post the information to your Made2Manage network.

The Made2Manage CD includes software, for the host computer, that facilitates the collection and posting of bar code transactions. This software logs each transaction as you record it—either directly from the wall-mounted station or when downloading data from the portable station. It also enables you to post these transactions from the host computer to Made2Manage.
