Made2Manage helps you determine the existing purchasing needs based on your company's existing inventory and sales, job, and purchase orders. Made2Manage stores that purchasing need information in the purchasing queue, which makes it easy to determine purchasing needs and quickly place purchase orders. The purchasing queue can save you time because it calculates purchasing needs and can select vendors for you.

You can also create a purchase order without using the purchasing queue.

To calculate net purchasing need, Made2Manage subtracts the items your company needs from the items your company already has available. The quantity available excludes any quantities stored in non-nettable inventory locations.

Notice that Made2Manage includes some information in the purchasing queue only when that information appears in a particular status. If you want Made2Manage to include information not in those statuses in its purchasing queue calculations, change the information's status. For example, you need to change a sales order status to Open before Made2Manage includes the items you need to buy for it in the purchasing queue.
