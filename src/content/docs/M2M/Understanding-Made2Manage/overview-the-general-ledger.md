The accounting process traditionally focuses on two main components the journal, which serves as a chronological record of business transactions, and the general ledger (GL), a comprehensive collection of accounts detailing debits and credits. .
When a business transaction occurs, an accountant records it in a journal. Made2Manage includes four subledgers (accounts payable, accounts receivable, order costing, and payroll) which functions as journals. Each journal entry includes:

-	The transaction date 

-	The description of the transaction.

-	Each account to debit and the corresponding amounts (Also called GL)   classify and summarize the increases and decreases of assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity. In Made2Manage, these accounts also track users and maintain separation of actions, with users logging in using their usernames and passwords. A debit represents an increase in assets, cost of goods sold, or expense accounts, and a decrease in liabilities, shareholder equity, or revenue accounts.

-	Each account to credit and the amount(s) to credit.

Later, the accountant posts the transaction's debits and credits to the GL. Each posting shows:

-	The date of the original transaction.

-	The description of the transaction.

-	The page number on which the entry appears in the journal.

-	The amount debited or credited.

-	The account's new balance.

At the end of an accounting period, and always before printing financial statements, the accountant must make adjusting entries to ensure the proper matching of revenues and expenses. Adjusting entries represent financial activity that has occurred but are not yet recorded.

Finally, the accountant prepares financial statements, and closes the period by making closing entries. These entries transfer the balances of temporary revenue and expense accounts to the permanent shareholders' equity account, resulting in a zero balance for revenue and expense accounts so they can accumulate new balances in the next period.
