In Made2Manage, posting to the general ledger includes posting transactions from four subledgers and making manual journal entries.
Each subledger functions like a journal, : storing detailed information about business transactions.


| Action  | Description    |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Receive an accounts payable invoice.                | Enters a transaction in the accounts payable subledger.    |
| Send an accounts receivable invoice.                | Enters a transaction in the accounts receivable subledger. |
| Receive a shipment from a vendor or ship an order.  | Enters a transaction in the order costing subledger.       |
| Copy payroll transactions from your payroll system. | Enters them in the payroll subledger.    |

You must post each subledger to the general ledger to credit and debit the appropriate accounts. Made2Manage offers  various methods for posting subledgers.

-	If you post manually, you enter the subledger's transactions yourself.

-	If you post nightly, the Command Scheduler posts the subledger's transactions to the general ledger each night.

-	If you post immediately, when a transaction is entered in the subledger, it also posts the transaction to the general ledger. (Immediate posting is available only for accounts payable and accounts receivable.)

-	If you select never to post to the general ledger, you must manually create a journal entry to transfer subledger information 
 
Certain events,  such as filling the petty cash box and making end-of-period adjustments, do not generate subledger transactions and require. manual journal entries that posts directly to the general ledger.

At the end of a period, after making adjusting journal entries and printing financial statements, you can close the period.  with just a few clicks in Made2Manage; individual closing journal entries are not necessary.
