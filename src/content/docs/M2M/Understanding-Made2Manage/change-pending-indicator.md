A field box in the item master, job order, or sales order indicates when an ECO is in process for a part. The field becomes unavailable when the last ECO in process changes to completed status. The number of the last ECO appears in the Last ECO box.

To view the ECO history of a part, click the **Last ECO** Lookup Reference.
