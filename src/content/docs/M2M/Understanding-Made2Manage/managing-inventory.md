Made2Manage allows you to track inventory items effectively. n item quantity may be stored in  an inventory location, within a bin or at an inspection location, or for a particular job, or as floor stock (in production, but not for a particular job).

Made2Manage determines committed item quantities (those required by a source of demand) based on sales orders, job orders, and safety stock. Finished goods on sales orders and component parts on job orders are considered  committed. The system calculates the quantity available by subtracting the committed quantity from the on-hand quantity.

You can track the movement of inventory items between locations, from inventory to a job in production, from a job to inventory, or from one job to another. Additionally, you can track items that need rework or scrapping. Every time you record the movement of inventory in Made2Manage, you record an inventory transaction.

You can check various documents and reports for items for ordering, identify  vendor issues, review received items, check production inspection results, track shipped items, and view an item's history based on the documents associated with it.
