You can use estimating software from other vendors to create quotations for products you sell. The software generates an estimate of file you can import into Made2Manage.

> [!Important] Import data only with the full involvement of **Implementation Consulting** or **Customer Support**, who provide expertise and additional tools to ensure success. importing data without their complete involvement may void your support contract for any issues does not that arise. In such cases, you can arrange for support for data import problems from Consona ERP, Inc. for an extra charge of time and materials.

Before you import a quotation, export the information from the estimating software into a comma- delimited text file. In the estimating software, arrange the data to use these field names and properties:

| Field      | Type      | Size | Description            | Required |

- In the **faType** field, enter **S** for an item record.

- Include fields that begin with **fa** in all records. Include fields that begin with **fs** only in **S** records.
