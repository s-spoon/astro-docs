You can select the number of component parts within a lot-controlled item for which to enforce lot control. On the **Item Master (INV)** page, in the **Extent of Control** list, select from three options for the extent of lot control.

If your company does not have a policy about which components to place under lot control, consider adding one.

| Option          | Meaning                                                                        |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Some components | Place at least one component on the item's bill of material under lot control. |
| All components  | Place all components on the item's bill of material under lot control.         |
| No components   | Place none of the components under lot controlâ€”only the item itself.           |
