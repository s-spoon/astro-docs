User permissions are part of your system's security. You can control users' access to various pages and protect sensitive business data. For example, you can prevent salespeople from changing information in active item masters and from changing engineering change orders (ECOs).

Anyone who has permission to add, change, or remove information in the **Item Master**, **Job Orders**, or **Sales Orders** page can do so while these pages are in standard status. However, if the item is under ECM control, the user needs ECM permissions to change it once the part is active or obsolete.

Some users may need "override" permissions to:

- Change an item even when it is under ECM control.

- Change information in an ECO even when they are not its author.

Your system administrator may be the only user with sufficient permissions to set user permissions.
