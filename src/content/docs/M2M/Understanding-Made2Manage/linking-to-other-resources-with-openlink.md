OpenLink lets you customize Made2Manage to give you fast access to resources you use often, including pages, reports, menus, graphs, and external programs.

Many such links already exist. For example, the **Purchase Orders (PO)** page links to the **Job Orders (JO)** page.

- On the **More Actions** pane, in the **Related** section when you select **Job Orders**, the **Job Orders (JO)** page opens with the job order the purchase order references.

- Or on the **Sales Orders (SO)** page, on the **More Actions** pane, in the **Reports** section, select **Sales Order Document** to view the order.

You can also create links to external programs. For example, if you develop a sophisticated pricing program, you can add a link to it from the **Sales Orders (SO)** page.

Use filters to choose information from the source page to the linked page. For example, say you create a link to the **Job Order Status (RPJOSS)** report from the **Purchase Orders (PO)** page. You can send the job order number from the selected purchase order item to the report, so you don't have to select the job order number in the report page.

To create filters, you need to understand the database structure of Made2Manage.
