Service order line items, such as parts, also have statuses. As events occur, line item statuses change. Typically, you manually change a line item's status only after the parts have been installed. The fol lowing parts will appear on the sales order:
-	Only parts designated for installation  can achieve the installed status.
-	Only potential service parts and service repair kits or tools will appear on related sales orders and shipping documents.
-	Parts designated for return will only appear on related return receivers.
-	Potential service parts can be either installed or returned (if they are not used or needed).
