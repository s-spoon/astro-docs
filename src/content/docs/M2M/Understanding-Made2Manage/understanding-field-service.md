Manage tasks associated with the service and repair of the equipment through the Field Service module. This module also establishes a method by which you can monitor and analyze repair or service problems and trends by specific components over time.

Use Field Service to help you administer warranty information and track and analyze customer-service orders and service-order costs.

Field Service lets you track service orders from order entry to issue resolution. This includes:

- Defining the details of the problem.

- Setting up preventive maintenance.

- Adding machines.

- Assigning technicians to the service order.

- Estimating costs and recording actual costs.
