You can set up Made2Manage so that whenever you change an ECO's status, Made2Manage sends a Notifier or email message to everyone on the ECO's broadcast distribution list. You can cut and paste information about the changes into the comments box (Also called field) *A square or rectangular area on the Made2Manage interface that displays information or in which you type, select information, or show a checkmark.* of the **ECO Summary Change Status** window so that vendors, customers, and Made2Manage users know the details of the change.
