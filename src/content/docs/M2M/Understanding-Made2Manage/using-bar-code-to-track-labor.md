Print bar codes that represent job orders, work centers, operations, and the types of labor you perform.

To record a labor transaction, drag the wand connected to the wanding station over a bar code that identifies the function, which is the type of transaction. Then follow the prompts the wanding station displays to complete the transaction. This involves wanding other bar codes and keying in information such as the quantity of items produced.

To print a list of bar code functions that represent the type of labor to perform or record or to print bar codes for work centers, see the related information. To print bar codes for a job order number and the operations in its routing, print the floor traveler for the job. See the **.

The wanding station posts each transaction to the host computer. You then post the transactions from the host computer to Made2Manage on your computer network. Then you can update your inventory information in Made2Manage.

Every employee can have a bar code badge that holds information such as their name, employee number, and their department. When recording labor, an employee scans the badge to identify himself or herself as having performed the work.

You can also set up automatic break periods and grace periods for employees who use bar code badges to record their labor. An automatic break subtracts time from the job an employee performs. You can set automatic breaks so that an employee does not have to clock on and off for every unpaid allowed break in a work period. A grace period rounds the time that an employee clocks on and off of a job.

Do not confuse indirect labor with the bar code **F4** **Clock-Off Indirect** function. Use the bar code F4 Clock-Off function to record labor tasks like maintenance and compensated breaks.
