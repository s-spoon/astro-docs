Made2Manage enables you to track inventory items. A quantity of an item may be at an inventory storage location or in a bin at a storage location. Or it may be at an inspection location. A quantity may be in production for a particular job. Or it may be floor stock (in production, but not for a particular job).

Made2Manage determines committed item quantities (quantities required by a source of demand) from sales orders, job orders, and safety stock. (Finished goods on sales orders are committed. So are component parts on job orders.) Made2Manage calculates quantity available by subtracting the committed quantity from the on-hand quantity.

You can track the movement of an item quantity from one location to another, from inventory to a job in production, from a job to inventory, or from one job to another. You can also track items that you must rework or scrap. Every time you record the movement of inventory in Made2Manage, you record an inventory transaction.

You can check various documents and reports for items to order, problems with vendors or their parts, items received, production inspection results, items shipped, and an item's history in terms of the documents on which it appears.
