If you have purchased Advanced Planning, or Advanced Scheduling, and have the Synch server installed you can use the Made2Manage Capable to Promise CTP functionality. (CTP) is the amount of inventory or projected inventory not committed to sales orders for a specific date. Made2Manage uses the Planning and Scheduling modules to assess the current load on work center capacity when calculating CTP, ensuring realistic inventory amounts.

CTP checks component availability throughout the supply chain and checks the availability of raw materials to determine if a particular product can be delivered by a specific date. A negative CTP quantity generally indicates unsupported customer demand.


CTP is only available only after you activate it on the **CSSALE** page. You can then access the **CTP** page as follows:

| Access CTP  | Purpose|   
|---------|-----|
| In the **Navigation** box, type **CTP**, and press **Enter**.   | Quickly check the CTP date and available to promise quantity for a specified part. Only standard parts with routings can be checked. The results are displayed for informational purposes only and are not saved. |
|In the **Navigation** box, type **SO** and click **Enter**. Check for the Sales Order, and click **CTP**.| View the CTP date and the ATP quantity for items on a sales order, and accept or reject those dates.|
| In the **Navigation** box, type **QUOTE** and click **Enter**. Check for the Quote, and click **CTP**.| View the CTP date and the ATP quantity for items on a quote, and save or ignore those dates.    |
