- Use an Ethernet network with throughput of at least 10 MB per second, but preferably 100 MB per second.
- Ensure your file server and all workstations contain a good amount of RAM. Best amounts of RAM depend heavily on your company's environment, but workstations need at least 32 MB and file servers need at least 64 MB.
- Defragment your hard disks regularly so computers can make best use of swap files and temporary files.
- If you use a Novell network, turn off the "read after write" flag to speed up saving information to disk by eliminating verification of written data.
- If you use Novell NetWare version 4.1, use Novell Client 32 drivers for best performance. Ensure the setting for Opportunistic locking is set to `False` to prevent your system from locking up.
