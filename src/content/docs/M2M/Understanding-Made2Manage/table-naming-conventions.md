Made2Manage names database tables to identify their contents. For example, ARSTAX contains **accounts** **receivable** **sales** **tax** information, and JODRTG contains **job** **order** **detailed** **routing** information.

The first two letters of a table name abbreviate the table's general contents.

The last four characters of a table name abbreviate the table's specific information. These letters can be anything, but MAST and ITEM, appear frequently and always mean the same thing.
