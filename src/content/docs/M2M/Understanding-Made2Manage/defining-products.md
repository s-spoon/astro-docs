You create a product definition that encompasses all of a product's features options, and  rules that govern configuring the product.

Do not confuse product definition with product itself. A product definition sets the features, options, and rules for configuring a product.

The extent of your rule capability depends on whether you bought the features-and-options– based Product Configurator or the rules-based Product Configurator.
