Use the Command Scheduler to set up tasks you to run automatically at specified times. You can schedule tasks that are:

-	Made2Manage processes (example regenerating the purchasing queue).
-	DOS batch files (.bat) and executable programs (.exe).
-	Windows programs (.exe).

Tasks can be scheduled to run **once**, **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly**, or **quarterly** at the time you choose. 
If you manage multiple companies in Made2Manage, you can schedule tasks for one or all companies. You can also restrict the task execution to a specific user.
Made2Manage comes with several predefined tasks, which can be disabled if not required.
