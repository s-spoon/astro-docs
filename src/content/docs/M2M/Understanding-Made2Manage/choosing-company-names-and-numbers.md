Each company has a name and a number. The first company you add is number 01. Made2Manage numbers companies sequentially.

Made2Manage stores data for all companies in a central data directory. The **SysPath** entry in **\Windows\M2MWin.ini** shows this directory. Made2Manage stores information for **01 company** in the **Data01** **subdirectory**, for **02 company** in the **Data02 subdirectory**. 

For example, if **SysPath** is **N:\M2MData**, then information for **company 01** is in **N:\M2MData\Data01**.
