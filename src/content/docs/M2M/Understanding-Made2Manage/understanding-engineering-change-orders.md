An engineering change order (ECO) records an engineering change you select to manage. To maintain accurate records and a uniform engineering change policy, create an ECO for every change that you want to make to a record.

An ECO has an author who creates the ECO and / or updates the ECO's progress.

Create an ECO when you:

- Change or remove an item master, job order, or sales order.

- Add, change, or remove a component in an item master, job order, sales order, standard bill of material, or standard routing under ECM control.

- Unless you have ECM override permissions, you must add an ECO for these changes.

You can allow override permissions on records under ECM control . Your system administrator may be the only user with sufficient permissions to set user permissions.
