When a customer requests service, do the following initial actions:
-	Add a service order.
-	Identify a machine.
-	Specify the service date.
-	Enter estimated service expenses.
- Assign a due date and a technician to the service order.

Then you can create a sales order based on this service order. The first step in creating a service order is recording the customer problem and information.

Field service also allows you to ship and receive service parts. The shipping process is the same as shipping other sales-order items. You receive returned field-service parts in the same way as you receive other shipments from vendors and customers.

You invoice the customer after you confirm the receipt of service parts by using the associated sales order as the source of the invoice, unless the service-order type is a replacement part only. In this case, the customer is invoiced through the associated M2M shipper.
