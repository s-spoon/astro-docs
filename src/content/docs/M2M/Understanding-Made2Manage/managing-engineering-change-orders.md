An Engineering Change Order (ECO) documents an engineering change that you select to manage. To maintain accurate records and a consistent engineering change policy, create an ECO for every change that you wish to implement.

Each ECO has an author responsible for creating, and updating its progress. You must create an ECO when you:

-	Change or remove an item master job order, or sales order.

-	Add, change, or remove a component in an item master, job order, sales order, standard bill of material, or standard routing under ECM control.

-	Unless you have ECM override permissions, you must add an ECO for these changes.

You can allow override permissions can be granted for records under ECM control. Only system administrator has sufficient permissions to set user permissions.
