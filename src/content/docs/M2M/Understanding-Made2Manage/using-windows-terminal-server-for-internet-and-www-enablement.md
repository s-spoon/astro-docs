When you use Windows Terminal Server (WTS), users can access Made2Manage from a host computer over the Internet, allowing connection when they are away from the office.

WTS has some limitations. For details, see "Working with Made2Manage through Windows Terminal Server" in the **.

To use WTS, set up a server with:

- A direct Internet connection and a valid Internet IP address.

- WTS software.

See the *WTS documentation* for instructions.

- Made2Manage software.

See the *Installation Guide* for instructions.

> [!Important] Do not use your WTS server to host Made2Manage bar code too. Bar Code needs its own server.

You must also install WTS on all client computers.
