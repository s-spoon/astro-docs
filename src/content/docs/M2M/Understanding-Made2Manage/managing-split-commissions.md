Split commission refers to the division of commissions between multiple salespeople. Made2Manage allows you to assign a specific salesperson and commission rate to each sales order line items or release.

To associate split commission, first set the commissions general ledger account in the Product Classes (PRCL) page to either a COGS or expense account. 

Commission can be defined using a commission code, a code which reflects a specific commission rate. You can create different commission codes for varying sales commission rates. For example, one commission code to use for sales made during peak sales times (such as summer), and another to use for sales made during times of the year when sales levels are lower (such as winter). Then assign to each salesperson a specific commission rate for each commission code.
Additionally, you can associate different salespeople with specific customer or prospect addresses, ensuring that  the appropriate representatives are linked to customers with multiple locations. When you create a sales order and select the sold-to or ship-to address, the sales- person you associate with the address appears on the order.

Commissions become payable once approved in the Commissions Payable (COMPAY) page. You can export commissions data for internal salespeople to a Microsoft Excel spread- sheet, and post commissions for external salespeople to accounts receivable invoices.
