When a vendor (Also called supplier) sends an invoice to you, you record it in Made2Manage. The invoice becomes the basis of the checks you pay, and the debit memo becomes the basis of credits to your accounts. You can select an invoice type or select a debit memo.

The status of invoices and debit memos changes in Made2Manage to reflect where they are in payment.
