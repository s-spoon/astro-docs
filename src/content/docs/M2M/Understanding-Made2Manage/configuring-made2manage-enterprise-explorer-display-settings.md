The new **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** has combined several different duplicate explorers in the system:

- **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** screen

- **CRM Explorer (EXPL)** screen

- **Locator (LOC)** screen

You can view detailed information about the items in the system and allows you to drill through the relationships between **Sales**, **Manufacturing**, and **Financial information** available in the system. It provides an option to explore all the **Master** and **Transaction information** available in Made2Manage. You can check the status of any information and allows you to open the related document.

For example, if you select **Standard BOMs** it shows all the standard BOMs in the Made2Manage database. If you want to see a specific BOM, double-click on the part number and the standard BOM for that part appears. However, if you right-click on the part number, the details of the part number appears on the left panel of the screen. Expand the information and search for the form.
