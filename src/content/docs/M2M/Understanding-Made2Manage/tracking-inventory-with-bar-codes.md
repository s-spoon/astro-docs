You can print bar codes on shippers, receivers, and pick lists. Whenever you move items between locations, , transfer items from one job to another, or conduct a physical inventory, you can use the bar code system to record the information. If the part requires lot control, you can also use bar code to record the lot number.

To record an inventory transaction, swipe the wand connected to the wanding station over a bar code that identifies the transaction type. Follow the prompts displayed by the wanding sta tion to complete the transaction, which includes scanning additional bar codes and entering information such as the quantity of a part.

For information, on printing bar codes for a job order, inventory locations, or part numbers, see the related information. 

The wanding station transmits each transaction to the host computer, from which youcan post the transactions to Made2Manage on your computer network. This process allows you to update your inventory information in Made2Manage.
