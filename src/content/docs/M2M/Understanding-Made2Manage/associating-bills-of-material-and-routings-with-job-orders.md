A bill of material for a part function like a recipe’s ingredients list, detailing the part and its components. Maintaining bills of material is essential for estimating material costs. Materials are the physical entities consumed during product manufacturing. They can be elemental, such as steel sheeting; manufactured parts, like screws or plastic moldings; or assemblies.

A part's routing serves as recipe’s instructions, outlining the production path and sequentially listing the work centers and operations required to manufacture the part. Routings are used to estimate labor and overhead costs.

While parts generally have standard bills of material and routings, you can associate a casual or detailed bill of material and a detailed routing with the part when you include it in a job order if a standard is not available. Casual bills of material specify information without costs, whereas detailed bills and routings offer precise and can include costs. Casual bills and routings are usually created the first time you specify a part.

All job orders must have bills of material and routings. If a part lacks a standard bill of material, you can add a casual or detailed bill of material directly within the **Job Orders** page.
