A field box in the item master, job order, or sales order indicates when an ECO is in process for a part. The box is unavailable when the part's last ECO in process changes to completed status. The last ECO number appears in the Last ECO box.

To see the ECO history of a part, click the **Last ECO** Lookup Reference.
