The Business Analytics feature provides tools to access and analyze data, helping you make informed business decisions.
Since the reports run in Microsoft Excel, you must use Microsoft Excel 2000 or higher.

There are two important aspects of business analytics:
-	Predefined Reports: Made2Manage includes predefined sales and production reports available through the Transfer or **Executive Information System** tab. these reports, generate data in Excel spreadsheets and charts. You can use the output "as is", modify the criteria, adjust the layout, and save the new layout and use it as a basis for future reports.

-	Custom Reports: You can modify existing Made2Manage report or create a new report with Microsoft Excel template layouts using PivotTables and PivotCharts. you can add a new layout to any existing report, and choose to run either the "standard" report or the Microsoft Excel report. You can also cre-ate new Business Analytics reports through **RPMAKE**, and access through the **Transfer** or **Executive Information System** tab.

Business Analytics uses a "push methodology" to gather current data for the Excel template. ensuring security by leveraging existing user report permissions within Made2Manage ERP.
