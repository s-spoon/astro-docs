title: "Inter-Facility Transportation Cost Management"

Inter-facility transportation costs refer to the expenses incurred when moving items between facilities. These costs are included in an item's material cost during a cost roll-up. If you do not perform frequent cost roll-ups, manually add the inter-facility transportation costs to the material costs to ensure the accuracy of inventory and job costing amounts.

Ensure that these costs are accounted for to maintain accurate inventory records, which include finished goods, components, and raw materials that your company owns or holds for safekeeping. When inventory is issued to specific job orders, the associated costs become part of the work in process.
