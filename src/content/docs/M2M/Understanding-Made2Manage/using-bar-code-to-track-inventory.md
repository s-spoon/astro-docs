You can print bar codes on shippers, receivers, and pick lists. Every time you move items from one location to another, move items from one job to another, or take a physical inventory, you can use the bar code system to record the information. If the part requires lot control, you can also use bar code to record the lot number.

To record an inventory transaction, drag the wand connected to the wanding station over a bar code that identifies the function, which is the type of transaction. Then follow the prompts the wanding station displays to complete the transaction. This involves wanding other bar codes and keying in information such as the quantity of a part.

To print bar codes for a job order, for inventory locations, or for part numbers, see the related information. 

The wanding station sends each transaction to the host computer. You then post the transactions from the host computer to Made2Manage on your computer network. Then you can update your inventory information in Made2Manage.
