You can attach word processing documents, spreadsheets, movies, and programs to each product, feature, and option in the Product Configurator. As you configure products, the order entry interface lets you quickly open these files to help explain each product, feature, and option.

You can include files in these formats:

- Microsoft Word for Windows (.DOC)

- Microsoft Excel for Windows (.XLS)

- Microsoft Audio-Visual file (.AVI)

- Visual FoxPro compiled program (.FXP)

You can also attach illustrative pictures to your features. The pictures appear in order entry's Wizard interface. The pictures must be Windows Bitmaps (.BMP).
