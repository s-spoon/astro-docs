Made2Manage stores detailed information about each standard part in an item master. A standard part is any raw material, manufactured part, subassembly, or assembly that is frequently bought or produced, necessitating a standard record.

The item master stores the part number, description, and details about the part's design, production, costs, pricing, and storage location. You can set options for inventory and lot control, assign vendors for purchasing items, and view CAD drawings of parts. Various application areas in Made2Manage including bills of materials, routings, and production schedules, rely on accurate item master information, making it crucial to maintain each record diligently.

Engineering Change Management (ECM) facilitates the management of engineering changes to parts. It enables you to create item master revisions, enabling you to apply particular revision for a job and effectively control and track many types of changes.
