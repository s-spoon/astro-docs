The new Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR) consolidates multiple system explorers into a single interface:

-	Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR) screen
-	CRM Explorer (EXPL) screen
-	Locator (LOC) screen

EXPLOR enables you toview detailed information about the items in the system and allows you to navigation across Sales, Manufacturing, and Financial data.. It allows exploration of both Master and Transaction records, offering real-time insights into system status and providing links to related documents. 

For example, if you select Standard BOMs it displays all the standard BOMs in the Made2Manage database. To view a specific BOM, double-click the corresponding part number to open its details. Alternatively, right-click the part number to display its details in the left panel, where you can expand the information and search for the form.
