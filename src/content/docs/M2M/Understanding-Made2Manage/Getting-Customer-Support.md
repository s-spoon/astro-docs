If you cannot find an answer to your question in the online Help or in the online knowledge base, see the Aptean Knowledge customer-support portal.

If you have a current agreement for customer-support services, and you have a question or problem, you can create a ticket on Aptean Knowledge. A customer-support analyst will receive your ticket immediately and will reach out via phone or email to confirm receipt of your request.

Customer-support analysts respond to cases based on severity and the order in which they are received, regardless of whether you use the Made2Manage Ticket Management services or contact customer support directly.
