You can schedule many tasks to run in the background in Made2Manage. For example:

- Some tasks need to happen after certain other tasks have occurred. For example, every morning you might want to see several reports about the previous day's activity. You can schedule these reports to print after everyone has gone home. You pick up the reports at the printer on the way to your desk each day.

- Some tasks require lots of time or system resources and should run when system usage is low. For example, you can schedule posting your sub-ledgers to the General Ledger to run late in the evening or in the night.
