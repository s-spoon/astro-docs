Although Made2Manage provides many standard reports, you can design reports of your own. You can base a new report on an existing one, or create an entirely new report. After you add a new report, you can change it. You can also change, in certain ways, a standard Made2Manage report.


A report requires two main elements: a query (a type of data source) and a layout (sometimes called a template). A query collects the information the report shows. It gets information from database tables and passes the information to the report layout.

When you create a report, you provide a query and at least one layout. Made2Manage uses the layout to format the information into the report document. A single query can have several layouts—for example, you can have a detail layout and a summary layout, each showing a different level of detail about the same information.
