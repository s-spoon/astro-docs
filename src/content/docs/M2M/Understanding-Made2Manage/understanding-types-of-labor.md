Labor is either direct or indirect:

- Direct labor is any labor performed towards a job order.

- Indirect labor is any labor that is not associated with a job order, such as time spent in meetings or on vacation.

Do not confuse indirect labor with the barcode F4 Clock-Off Indirect function. Use the barcode F4 Clock-Off function to record labor tasks like maintenance and compensated breaks.

Made2Manage processes direct labor as regular, serial, or parallel:

- Regular labor processing records straight time spent working only one job over the time period.

- Serial labor processing records time spent on several short-run operations. It calculates the amount of time spent on each job based on the quantity completed for each operation.

- Parallel labor processing records time spent on more than one job simultaneously. The system then allocates the amount of time spent on each job.
