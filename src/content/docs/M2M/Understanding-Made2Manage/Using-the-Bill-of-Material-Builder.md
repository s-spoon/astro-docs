The **BOM Builder (BOMBLD)** page allows you to work with BOMs in a graphical interface. You can add parts to your BOMs by dragging them onto the bill with your mouse. Additionally,  the BOM builder enables you to quickly identify which BOMs utilize a specific part and allows you to navigate directly to any part’s BOM. 

You can resize and customize the Bill of Material Builder to fit it to the way you like to work.
