Using Made2Manage's optional lot control feature, you can track individual parts and batches throughout the production process. You assign a serial number to an individual part and a lot number to each batch.

Lot control functions let you trace an item back to its origin, whether purchased or manufactured it. You can identify which lots of items used to create a part and the lots that contain the finished product.

Note that backflush items cannot be lot-controlled.

Whenever you receive, ship, issue to a job, or move a lot-controlled part, its lot number accompanies it. Certain industries require lot control for part components so that, in the event of a defect, the manufacturer can each component’s production history.

The level of control required varies by  industry. You can apply lot control to a part and all, some, or none of its component parts. You can use lot control for all products or selectively for cer-tain order items. For instance, a request for lot control may appear on a sales order.

For a single part, a job can have multiple lot numbers. Made2Manage makes it easy to check the lot numbers associated with a particular job as well as the jobs or locations that contain parts from a specific lot.

You can also set expiration dates for your lots indicating the order in which they should be used. Although these dates appear on the production pick lists, Made2Manage does not enforce them.

Made2Manage can automatically generate lot numbers, reducing the  tedious data entry that can be part of lot-control tracking.

To generate lot numbers, perform the following:

1.	Enter lot numbers for several parts.
2.	Enter the first and last lot numbers.
3.	Click Auto Generate, toMade2Manage automatically fills in the numbers.

Made2Manage automatically generates lot numbers only on the Receiving (RECV) and Shipping
(SHIP) pages.

You can also assign lot numbers to assemblies before they are completed.

You can receive or issue materials directly to a lot number, eliminating entering lot information later.
