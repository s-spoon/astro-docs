You can associate bills of material and outgoings with items on your quotations and sales orders. Both documents can be casual or detailed. You can create casual bills of material and outgoings only for make items you do not keep in stock. You typically create casual bills of material and outgoings the first time you specify a part.

A casual bill of material loosely lists the parts needed to produce a component, and approximates material costs. In contrast, a detailed bill of material precisely lists the required parts, and precisely tracks material costs.

A casual routing loosely orders the operations needed to produce a component and approximates the production costs. A detailed routing however, precisely orders the operations you follow to produce a component and sums the production costs.
