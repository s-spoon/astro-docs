You can assign custom revision numbers to new or existing parts using the user-defined revision numbers feature in Made2Manage. This allows you to change user-defined revision numbers at any time across various Made2Manage pages. Note that these numbers are for informational purposes only and are not linked to previous revisions of a part.

Once you enable the user-defined revision numbers feature in Made2Manage, it cannot be disabled.

You can modify parts with user-defined revision numbers without the additional steps required by Engineering Change Management (ECM). Consequently, changes made to these parts do not create a revision history; instead, Made2Manage generates a new record that is not connected to any other part in the system.
You can use both user-defined revision numbers and engineering change management simultaneously in Made2Manage. This allows you to track revision history and maintain strict change control on ECM parts while parts with user-defined revision numbers do not require such oversight.

If you wish to assign user-defined revision numbers to existing parts, or convert existing user-defined revision numbers to use standard revision numbers, you can do so using  the **Revision Type Mass Change** (**INRTMC**) page.
