Labor can be classified as either direct or indirect:

-	Direct Labor: Work performed directly towards a job order.
-	Indirect Labor: Work  not associated with a job order, such as time spent in meetings or on vacation.
Note that indirect labor differs from barcode F4 Clock-Off Indirect function, which is used  to record labor tasks like maintenance and compensated breaks.

Made2Manage processes direct labor in three ways:

-	Regular Labor: Records time spent working only on a single job during the specific period.
-	Serial Labor: Captures time spent on several short-run operations, calculating the time allocated based on the quantity completed for each operation.
-	Parallel Labor: Records time spent on multiple job simultaneously, allocating the time accordingly for each job.
