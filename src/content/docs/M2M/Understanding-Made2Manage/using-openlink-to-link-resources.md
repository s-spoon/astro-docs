OpenLink allows you to customize Made2Manage for quick access to frequently used resources, such as pages, reports, menus, graphs, and external programs.
Many links are pre configured. For example, the **Purchase Orders (PO)** page links to the **Job Orders (JO)** page.

-	On the **More Actions** pane, in the Related section when you select **Job Orders**, the **Job Orders (JO)** page opens with the job order the purchase order references.
-	On the **Sales Orders (SO)** page, on the **More Actions** pane, in the **Reports** section, select **Sales Order Document** to display the order.

You can also create links to external programs. For example, if you develop a custom pricing program, you can add a link to it from the Sales Orders (SO) page.
filters can be applied to transfer information from source page to the other page. For example, linking the **Job Order Status (RPJOSS)** report from the Purchase Orders (PO) page. You can automatically send the job order number from the selected purchase order item to the report, eliminating the need to manually select it on the report page.

To create filters, you need to understand the database structure of Made2Manage.
