Sales tax codes and tax jurisdictions help you organize the taxes your customers, distributors, and vendors pay on your items, and how you handle taxes.
After you create sales tax codes, you combine these codes into tax jurisdictions. You apply jurisdictions throughout Made2Manage to show the combination of taxes a customer, vendor, or distributor pays or the grouping of taxes you pay when you purchase items.

For instance, if you plan to sell items to a potential customer. in the state of Wisconsin. the customer pays federal (U.S.) taxes, state (Wisconsin) taxes, and potentially local taxes. You create sales tax codes for each of these taxes, including the tax rate for each tax authority, how you calculate each tax, the general ledger accounts affected. These tax are then grouped into a jurisdiction.
