Made2Manage allows You to schedule tasks to run in the background. For instance:
-	Task Dependency: Some tasks need to occur after others. For example, you can schedule reports the previous day's activity to print after hours, allowing you to pick them up the next morning.

-	Resource-intensive tasks: Some tasks require significant  time or system resources and should run during off-peak hours. For example, you can schedule posting your sub-ledgers to the General Ledger to occur late in the evening or overnight.
