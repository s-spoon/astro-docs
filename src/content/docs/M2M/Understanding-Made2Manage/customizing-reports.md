Made2Manage provides many standard reports, but you can design create custom reports. You can either base a new report on an existing one, or design an entirely new report. Once a report is added, you can modify it, including making changes to standard Made2Manage report in certain ways.

Report consist of two main elements: a query (data source) and a layout (template). The query collects the information the report shows. It gets information from database tables and passes the information to the report layout.

When creating a report, you must provide a query and at least one layout. the layout to format data into the report document. A single query can have multiple layouts—for example, a detail layout and a summary layout, each showing a different level of detail for the same information.
