In Made2Manage, you perform tasks using pages that appear in a web browser. For example, to add accounts receivable invoices, you navigate to the relevant page for managing those invoices.

Most pages have a **mnemonic** for quick access, which appears beside the page name in the menu pane. You can toggle the visibility of mnemonics by pressing the Alt key.

You can open any page in several ways:

-   Using the menu pane.
-   Typing the page's mnemonic into the **Navigation** box in the menu pane, or into** Global Search** at the top-right corner of any page.
-   Using **Favorites** on the menu pane.
-   Using **Recent** on the menu pane.
