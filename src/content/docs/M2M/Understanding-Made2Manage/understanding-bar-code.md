Made2Manage's optional bar code system uses printed bar codes and scanning hardware to streamline labor and inventory tracking.
The system administrator sets up the bar code system. 

A bar code consists of a series of vertical bars with varying widths and spaces That encode identifying information. For instance, Made2Manage inventory bar codes identify parts, inventory locations, and movements. When you scan a bar code with a wand, the system interprets the code and inputs the information into Made2Manage.

The bar code system has three elements:
1.	The Wanding Station.
2.	The Bar Code Host Computer.
3.	Your Made2Manage Computer Network.

 You collect the information at the Wanding station, then transfers to the bar code host computer, which compiles , organizes and posts the information to Made2Manage.
