When the cost of a part or assembly changes, record the change in the item master.

>[!NOTE]
> If the costs for many items change, roll up the costs instead of changing them one by one.

When you change the cost of a part or assembly in the item master, you create postings to the general ledger. If you reduce the cost of an item, you debit the **Product Class Material Variance** account and credit the **Product Class Inventory** account. If you increase the cost of an item, you debit the **Product Class Inventory** account and credit the **Product Class Material Variance** account.

To view costs transferred to the general ledger, print the **Order Cost Data Trans to GL** report before and after you change costs for a part or assembly.
