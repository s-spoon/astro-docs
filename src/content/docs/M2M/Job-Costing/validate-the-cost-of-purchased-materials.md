Your company probably has vendors from which you regularly purchase items. Purchasing employees can send a request for quotation (RFQ) to the vendor, asking for an estimate of costs for an item. Purchasing can then follow up with a purchase order. Made2Manage records this information so you can refer to it easily.

You can verify purchasing costs by comparing the cost you actually paid for purchased materials with costs you agreed to pay on the purchase orders.

## To verify costs of purchased goods

1. [Check the costs you specified on the purchase order.](check-costs-on-a-purchase-order.md)

2. [Check accounts payable invoice for the amounts the vendor charged you.](check-charges-on-an-accounts-payable-invoice.md)

    You can also print a report of purchasing variances that includes cost information.
