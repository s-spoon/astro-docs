Sometimes you need to make cost adjustments for a job that is already in process. For example, if a customer agrees to accept a partial shipment when your company completes a portion of the job, and your company ships those items, you adjust funds in the cost of goods sold and work in process accounts to better match COGS and revenue.

When you adjust costs for works in process, you post transactions to the general ledger. You post to the accounts indicated on the **WIP Adjustments** screen.

>[!TIP]
> To view costs transferred to the general ledger, print the **Order Cost Data Trans to GL** report before and after you adjust the cost of a work in process. You can also check the cost of goods sold.
