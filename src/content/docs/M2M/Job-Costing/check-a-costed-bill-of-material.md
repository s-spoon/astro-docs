A costed bill of material details the material used to make a part and breaks down the costs for each component in the part.

You can also view the costs for a part or assembly in the item master.

  >[!NOTE] 
  >- After you roll up costs in the **Inventory Cost Roll Up (CRUP)** page, the costs in the **Costed BOMS (BOMCST)** page is displayed based on the Yields in **RTG**. 
  >- If the unit of measure is Each (EA) or Piece (PC), the Operation quantity will be rounded up to the next integer after the calculation with yield and used for computing the labor and overhead costs. 
  >- If the unit of measure is other than EA or PC, the Operation quantity will remain as it is (decimal/integer) after the calculation and the same is used for computing the labor and overhead costs.
