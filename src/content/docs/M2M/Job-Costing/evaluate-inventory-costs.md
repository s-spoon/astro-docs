You can use Made2Manage to look at inventory, purchase, and job costs so you can reduce overall company costs, increase efficiencies and profit, and ensure that your company's prices remain competitive.

Made2Manage lets you look at inventory costing, or the costs you incur when you perform transactions for items in inventory. For example, you may need to determine the costs of parts and assemblies your company needs to produce a product, or you may need to review the operations your company follows to produce a product.

## To evaluate inventory costs

1. [Review the costs for standards parts in inventory.](check-costs-for-standard-items.md)


2. [Review a list of all the parts and assemblies needed to produce a product (that is, review the bill of material or BOM).](view-a-standard-bill-of-material.md)

3. [Review the operations needed to produce a product (that is, the routing).](view-a-standard-routing.md)


4. [To adjust inventory costs, change the cost for a standard item.](change-cost-information-for-a-part-or-assembly.md)


5. [To change the cost for many items, roll up inventory costs.](roll-up-inventory-costs.md)
