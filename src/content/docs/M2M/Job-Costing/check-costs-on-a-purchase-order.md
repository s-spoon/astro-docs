### Postings for job closing ###

When you close a job, Made2Manage calculates whether the job costs more than expected (a negative work *in process A status of physical inventory tag ranges that means you have added the individual tag records, but you have not yet posted them.*) or less than expected (a positive work in process). This sample ledger shows how closing transactions post for standard or *weighted average costing* methods:
   1. A type of inventory cost accounting that bases costs on information from existing inventory items and purchase orders for those items.
   2. A type of inventory cost accounting that bases costs on existing inventory plus total estimated values, divided by the total quantity in existing inventory plus the quantity moved to finished goods when the job order is complete.
