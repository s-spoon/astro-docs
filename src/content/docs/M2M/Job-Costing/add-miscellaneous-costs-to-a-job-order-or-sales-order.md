Sometimes you may need to add miscellaneous costs to a job or sales order. For example, you may need to add a non-standard items to a job's BOM. When you add miscellaneous costs, you post transactions to the general ledger. You debit the Cost of Goods Sold (material or miscellaneous) or the Work in Process (material or miscellaneous) account and credit a General Ledger account, usually an expense account.

To view costs transferred to the general ledger, print the **Order Cost Data Trans** to GL report before and after you add miscellaneous costs.
