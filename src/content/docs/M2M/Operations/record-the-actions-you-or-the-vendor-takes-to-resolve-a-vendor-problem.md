From time to time you may encounter a problem with a vendor. You can record the actions you or the vendor takes to resolve the problem.

Before you do this, you must record the initial inquiry you make to the vendor about the problem.



## To record an action for a vendor problem

1. Open the **Vendor Service Request (SYCSLV)** page.

    Navigate **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Quality > Vendor Service Request.**

    Or

    Search for **SYCSLV** or **Vendor Service Request** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Vendor Service Request**.

    The **Vendor Service Request (SYCSLV)** page appears.

2. On the **Toolbar**, click **Browse**.

    The **Browse For Vendor Service Request** window appears.

3. Select the row that contains the required service request, and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row that contains the required service request.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Browse For Vendor Service Request** window.

4. Click the **Activities** tab.

5. On the child toolbar, click **New**.

    Or, on the child toolbar, click **Copy** to base this action on the one the page shows.

6. Specify the action:

    1. Click the **Standard Response** lookup reference.

        The **Lookup For Standard Response** window appears.

    2. Select the row that contains the required action, and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row that contains the required action.

        Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Lookup For Standard Response** window.

    3. In the **Action** box, enter a description of the action.

    4. In the **Internal Notes** box, enter any notes.

    5. If the date and/or time in the **Action Date/Time** box is not correct, change it.

        - Double-click in the **Action Date/Time** box to populate the current date and time.

        - Click the calendar icon to display the calendar. Select the required date and time.

    6. In the **Activity Assigned To** list, select the person who's assigned to take the action.

    7. Click the **Job** **No** lookup reference.

        The **Lookup For Job No** window appears.

    8. Select the row that contains the required job order the action relates to, and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row that contains the required job order the action relates to.

        Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Lookup For Job No** window.

    9. In the **Activity Action By** dropdown list, select the person taking the action.

    10. In the **Next Action** dropdown list, select the next action.

        Or, if this action resolves the problem, select **Resolved**.

        When you record an action and mark its next step as resolved, Made2Manage closes the problem. But you can also close a problem without recording a resolving action. See the **.
