An engineering change order (ECO) stores information about engineering changes you select to manage. You can change an ECO's status to reflect its progress. You can also cut and paste information from other documents to explain the changes or progress.

Each time you change the status of the ECO, Made2Manage sends an e-mail or Notifier message to everyone in the broadcast distribution list. The message that they receive is displayed to be sent from the user who is currently signed in.
