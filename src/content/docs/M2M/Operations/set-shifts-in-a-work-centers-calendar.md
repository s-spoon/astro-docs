The work center calendar shows the working hours of a specific work center. For scheduling, the working time in the work center calendar overrides the working time in the production calendar. You can set shifts for a work center at any time. You set shifts for each day.

Before you can set a work center's shifts for a month, add the month. See the **Related information**. To set shift lengths and start and end times, set production capacity. 

If your company has multiple production facilities, set the shifts in a work center's calendar for each facility.
