Use the **Labor Efficiency** report to generate Employee, Department, Work Center, and Job Efficiencies. Available, worked, direct part of worked, and re-work hours as well as percentages are generated in the report. Also the quantity scrapped, quantities complete, and percentage of scrap are shown.

The purpose of the **Labor Efficiency** report is to compare the efficiencies of employees, work centers, or departments.

>[!NOTE] 
>The re-work figures only indicate the amount of time spent doing re-work. The re-work is not necessarily caused by the employee performing it.

By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use **Advanced Filters** to customize or expand your filter criteria. For more information on **Advanced Filters**, click here.
