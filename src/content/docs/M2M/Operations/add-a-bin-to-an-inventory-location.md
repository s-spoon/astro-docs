You can further divide an inventory location by assigning items to bins within the location. If you add bins to a location using the **Inventory Bins (BIN)** page, you can use only these bins when working on other Made2Manage pages. However, if you do not add bins to a location in the **BIN** page, you can add bin information elsewhere in Made2Manage such as the sales order and item master pages.

If you use bins, you must specify the bin every time you specify the location. However, you do not need to set up bins when setting up inventory locations. Instead, you can specify a bin when you add a part.
