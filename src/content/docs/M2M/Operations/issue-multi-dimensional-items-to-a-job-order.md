When you issue a part to a job, you can enter dimensions as well as quantities. Unless you issue a whole unit of the part, you must enter dimensions for the part. You can also track multi-dimensional parts you issue to a job.

Before you issue a multi-dimensional item, you must first record the part's dimensions. See the **Related Information**.
