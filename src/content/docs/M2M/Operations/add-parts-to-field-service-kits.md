Field-service kits let you group parts you need to service machines. You can specify field kits by machines, by customer locations, or both.

A field kit is typically a collection of parts needed to produce a specific service task. Usually you create an item master part for a field kit then assign each needed part as a component to a standard bill of material for the kit part. You would then issue and process an internal job for internal use to relieve inventory of the equipment items to establish the cost of the kit. Finally you create a service order for a machine using the field kit you define.

There are two types of field kits you can assign to a service order:

- Regular field kits allow you to specify a range of machines and/or customer locations where you want the kit installed.

- Regular field kits are needed for a particular machine or group of like machines.

- Site licenses allow you to pick a range of parts for the field kit from the item master, and Made2Manage finds the machines that contain those parts for you.

- Site licenses are needed for a particular component part.
