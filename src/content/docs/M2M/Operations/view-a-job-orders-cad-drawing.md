A job order authorizes and outlines the production of an item. You can view a CAD drawing for a part within its job order.

For more information on working with AutoCAD, search AutoCAD's help index.

To be able to view CAD drawings in Made2Manage, you must have a CAD viewer installed. Made2Manage works best with AutoDesk Viewer 2.0.
