You can schedule how often your company services a machine.

You can also set up a special set of item master parts for this purpose on the **Item Master (INV)** page. Use the Made2Manage standard routing method to establish the specific list of preventative maintenance tasks. Then use that set of part numbers to pull in the routing steps so that the related reports will contain a detailed description of the necessary tasks you need to perform.
