A machine's configuration contains the machine's component history. If you want to change only the machine history and not create a service order or actually ship any parts to the customer site, use the **Field Kit** window.

This is primarily used to reflect activities that occurred prior to the installation of Made2Manage's Field Service module.

If you find errors in a configuration record, you can also change the serial number or any of the related notes only.

## To update machine's history for field-service kits

1. Open the Field Kit (KITTBL) page.

    Navigate **Customer Relationship Management** > **Master Data** > **Field Service** > **Field Kit**.

    Or

    Search for **KITTBL** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Field Kit**.

    The **Field Kit (KITTBL)** page appears.

2. On the toolbar, click **Browse**.

    The **Browse For Field Kit** window appears.

3. Select a row and click **Select**.

    Or double-click the field-service kit whose machine configuration you want to update.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from **Browse For Field Kit** window.
