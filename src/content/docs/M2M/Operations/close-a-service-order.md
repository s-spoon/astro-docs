After you resolve the issue related to the service order, close the associated service order.

There are several items to check before you close a service order.

- There should only be one sales order in the open status. All other related sales orders should be closed or cancelled.

- Make sure that the estimated and/or actual costs are correct or reflect all billable activity.

- Now you can close the service order. By closing the service order, the system updates the open sales order properly so that the associated AR invoice will include all the necessary costs and charges. After invoicing is complete and posted, the order's status changes to closed.
