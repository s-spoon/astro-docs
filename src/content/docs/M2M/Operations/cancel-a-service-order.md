As you perform tasks associated with a service order, Made2Manage changes the service order's status. However, you must manually change the status of a service order to cancel depending on the order's progress.

You can change the service order to this status if you no longer need the service order, although the issue may not have been resolved.



## To cancel service order

1. Open the Field Service Control (FSORD) page.

    1. Select **Customer Relationship Management** > **CRM Transactions** > **Field Service**> **Field Service Control**.

    Or

    2. Search for **FSORD** or **Field Service Control** in the **Navigation box** and then select  **Field Service Control**.

    The **Field Service Control (FSORD)** page appears.

2. Click **Status**.

   The **Field Service Order Change Status** page opens.

3. Click **OK**. A message *Do you wish to change the status of Service Order to Cancelled?* appears.

4. Click **Yes**.
