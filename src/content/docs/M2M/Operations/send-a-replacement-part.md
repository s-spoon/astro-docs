## To send replacement part

1. Open the Field Service Control (FSORD) page.

    1. Select **Customer Relationship Management** > **CRM Transactions** > **Field Service**> **Field Service Control**.

    Or

    2. Search for **FSORD** or **Field Service Control** in the **Navigation box** and then select  **Field Service Control**.

    **Field Service Control (FSORD)** page appears.

2. Click the **Parts Information** tab.

3. On the child toolbar, click the **Copy** and select **Replace Part(s)** menu option.

4. To replace an installed part, select the **Level column** check box.

    If you want to replace all installed parts, click **Select All**.

5. Click **OK**.

For each item you select, the system creates two line items. The system assigns potential service part as item type for those parts that are not part of a machine's configuration and as item to be returned for the parts that are part of the machine configuration.
