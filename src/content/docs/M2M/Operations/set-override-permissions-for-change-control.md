Engineering Change Management (ECM) lets you control changes users make to records. However, you can permit users with ECM override permissions to override change control for the documents.

If a user overrides ECM control of an audited record, Made2Manage still tracks the changes you make to the record.

## To set override permissions for ECM control

1. Open the **Production (CSPROD)** page.

    1. Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **Production**.

    Or

    2. Search for **CSPROD** or **Production** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Production**.

    The **Production (CSPROD)** page appears.

2. Click the **ECM** tab.

3. In the **Control Configuration** section, select the **Allow Override** checkbox for the records that you want to allow employees with ECM override permission to override change control and make changes.

4. On the toolbar, click **Save**. The override permission changes are saved.
