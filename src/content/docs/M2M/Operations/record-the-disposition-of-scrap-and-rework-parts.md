You can view details of the disposition of rework and scrap of parts.

To perform this task you must first record inspection results for the part. See the **Related Information**.

## To verify **scrap** and **rework** parts

1. Open the **Disposition of Rework & Scrap (DISPRS)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Quality** > **Disposition of Rework & Scrap**.

        Or

    - Search for **DISPRS** or **Disposition of Rework & Scrap** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Disposition of Rework & Scrap**.

    The **Disposition of Rework & Scrap (DISPRS)** page appears.

2. Select the item whose disposition you want to record.

3. If you do not want to further track the disposition and want to absorb the costs for rework or scrap into the job order, click the **Absorbed in the Job without Any Changes**.

4. If you changed the routing to reflect any changes that were needed to complete the job order, click the **Edited the Job** **Routing** **to Reflect Added Work and/or Quantity**.

    > [!Note] Made2Manage does not make changes in the routing for you. You must make these changes from the **Job Order** window using the **Detail** option in the **Routing** section.

5. To create a sub-job for the items:

    1. Select **Create Sub-Job** radio button.

    2. Click the ellipsis under the **Action** column.

    3. Select **Grid Actions** > **SubJob-Routing**.

        The **Job Order Detailed RTG** window appears.

        Or, click **Cancel** if you wish to create the routing later.

6. To assign the rework or scrap to an existing job order:

    1. Select the **Assign Rework/Scrap to Job No** radio button.

    2. Click the **Job No** lookup reference.

        The **Lookup For Job No** window appears.

    3. Select the row and click **Select**. Or double-click the job order to use.

        Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Lookup For Job No** window.
