Made2Manage stores information about each standard part or assembly in an item master. When you receive a buy-to-order or buy-to-stock item, Made2Manage updates the vendor information on the item master. You can also manually record a vendor. When you first add an item master, it's a good idea to assign a primary vendor to the part.

>[!NOTE] Before you do this, you must record the part's basic, design, production, and cost information.
