You can set or change general ledger accounts for field service.

Before you set general ledger accounts, you must set up field service to post service-order expenses and labor to the general ledger. Make sure to select Post Expenses checkbox.Select this box only if you want to create general journal entries for these expenses during the change status to the closed status of an event. For instructions about setting field service's general behavior, see the **.

You can still assign general ledger accounts and then use these accounts to sum activity costs by accounts on a report and not have them be booked to your general ledger. The general ledger is still booked in the normal fashion for all shipments and invoices based upon the sales order line item product classes. This section deals only with these expenses detailed on the technicians expense Excel worksheet.
