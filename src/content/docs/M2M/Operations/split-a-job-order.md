Sometimes a customer needs fewer items than they originally ordered. In those cases, you can split the job order and put any extra items in inventory or towards another job order. You can also split a job order to relieve bottlenecks at a work center.

You can set the quantity of materials and labor to transfer to the split job, or automatically transfer a set of default quantities that Made2Manage calculates.

How does Made2Manage calculate default quantities for materials and labor?
