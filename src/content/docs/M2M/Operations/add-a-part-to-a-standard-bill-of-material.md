## To add part to standard bill of material

>[!Note] Follow this procedure only if the component part is *not* the first one you are adding to the bill of material.

1. Open the **Standard BOMs (BOM)** page.

    1. Select **Production Management** > **Master Data** > **Standard BOMs**.

    Or

    2. Search for **BOM** or **Standard BOMs** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Standard BOMs**.

    The **Standard BOMs (BOM)** page appears.

    Or double-click the row that contains the required bill of material.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Browse For Standard BOMs** window.

4. On the child toolbar, click **New**.

    Or

    On the child toolbar, click **Copy** > **Current** to base the new component on the component highlighted in the BOM component list.

5. Click the **Component** lookup reference.

    The **Lookup For Component** window appears.

6. Select the row that contains the required component, and click **Select**.

    Or double-click the row that contains the required component.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Lookup For Component** window.

7. Click **Save**. The part details are added to the standard bill of material.

## To add component based on manufacturer part

1. On the **Standard BOMs (BOM)** page, on the child toolbar, click **Copy** > **From Manufacturer Part**.

    The **Copying From Manufacturer Part** window appears.

2. Select the row that contains the required manufactured part, and click **Select**.

    The **Lookup For Component** window appears.

4. Select the row that contains the required part number, and click **Select**.

5. In the **Unit Quantity** box, enter the required quantity of the component part.

    Or, click the Calculator icon to display the Calculator. Enter the required value.

6. In the **Memo** box, enter descriptive information about the component part.

    The memo that appears is the memo on the part's item master.

7. Specify the part's details:

    1. Clear the **Extend** checkbox, if you do not want to multiply the component quantity by the parent quantity.

    2. You may want to do this if you need less of the item to complete the operation. For instance, if the item is a tooling and the standard process quantity is 10, you may only want one tooling per standard process quantity instead of 10.

    4. In the **Item Number** box, enter an item number.

        The item number identifies the part on the bill of material and drawings.
