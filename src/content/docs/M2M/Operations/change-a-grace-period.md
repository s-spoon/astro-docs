You can set grace periods for activities that you enter using barcode. For example, to allow employees to clock-in when they arrive but pay them only from the beginning of their 7:30 shift, set a grace period that shows all clock-in's between 7:15 and 7:35 as happening at 7:30.

If you enter a grace period for an employee, the employee does not get any grace periods you assign for the department or company. If you enter a grace period for a department, the department does not get any grace periods you assign for the company. So if you assign an employee a special grace period but want the employee to receive the department and company grace periods, set those grace periods up for the employee too.
