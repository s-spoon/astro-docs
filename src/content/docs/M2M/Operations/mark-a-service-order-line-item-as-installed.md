As you perform tasks associated with a service order, Made2Manage changes service-order line item statuses. However, when you receive confirmation that a new component has been installed, you must manually change the status of a service-order line-item to installed.

    1. Select **Customer Relationship Management** > **CRM Transactions** > **Field Service**> **Field Service Control**.

    2. Search for **FSORD** or **Field Service Control** in the **Navigation box** and then select  **Field Service Control**.

    The **Field Service Control (FSORD)** page appears.

2. Click the **Parts Information** tab.

3. In the grid, select the row that contains the required part.

4. Click **Status** drop-down and select **Installed**.

5. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**. The status of the line item is changed.
