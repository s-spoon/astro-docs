If you need to record further details of a service order, you can type additional information on the **Service Order Problem Detail** window, available through the **Field Service Control (FSORD)** page. This is where you can record and classify the nature of the basic problem as well as define the specific technical problem with specific machine components.

You can also add information after you receive a report from the field. This allows you to update machine configuration even after you close a service order.
