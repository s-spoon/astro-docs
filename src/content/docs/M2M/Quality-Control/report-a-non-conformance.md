You can report a non-conformance to a gatekeeper; that is, a Powerway user who electronically distributes non-conformance reports to other users for consideration as **Corrective Action Requests (CARs)**.

You can report a non-conformance while working in Made2Manage.

You can report a non-conformance only if your company uses the **Powerway Corrective Action** module.

To report a non-conformance

1.  Click the **Non-conformance**.

    The **Nonconformance Reporting Wizard** opens. For more information on using this wizard, see the **Powerway documentation**.
