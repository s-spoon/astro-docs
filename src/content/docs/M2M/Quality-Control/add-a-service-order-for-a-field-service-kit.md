After you identify what parts to include in field-service kits and the destination of the service kits, you can generate a service order.

## To add a service order for a field-service kit

1.  Open the **Field Kit (KITTBL)** page.

    1. Select **Customer Relationship Management** > **Master Data** > **Field Service** > **Field Kit**.

        Or

    1.  Search for **KITTBL** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Field Kit.** <br> The **Field Kit (KITTBL)** page appears.
2.  On the child toolbar, click **Copy**.
3.  Click the **Assign Field Kits To**.

    If the part number that represents the kit is a phantom, you have to specify it as a 'MAKE' type on the sales order so you can create a job order and get the part out of inventory.

    Now you can view the field kits used on machines.
