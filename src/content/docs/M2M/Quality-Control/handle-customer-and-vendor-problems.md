When a customer has a problem with an order, record the problem in Made2Manage so you can track progress in resolving it.

You can also track problems with a vendor. For instance, you may receive a faulty part or the wrong part. You can track a vendor problem from your initial inquiry to the vendor through the problem's resolution.

To handle customer problems

1.  [Add a customer problem](add-a-customer-problem.md).
2.  [Close a customer problem](close-a-customer-problem.md). 
3.  [If the problem resurfaces, reopen it](reopen-a-customer-problem.md). 

To handle vendor problems

1.  [Add a vendor problem](add-a-vendor-problem.md). 
2.  [Record actions on a vendor problem](record-the-actions-you-or-the-vendor-takes-to-resolve-a-vendor-problem.md). 
3.  [Close a vendor problem](close-a-vendor-problem.md). 
4.  [If the problem resurfaces, reopen it](reopen-a-vendor-problem.md). 

    If a problem recurs, your company may adopt a standard response to the problem.
