To use field service with the rest of Made2Manage, you must first set it up.

## To set up field service

1.  Add the tools and machines you'll use. Add 'tool' records to describe repair or installation tool kits that may be needed to perform the service. These are non- inventory items that are used and returned. You never bill the customer for these items.

2.  Add warranties.

4.  [Set general field service behavior](set-field-service's-general-behavior.md)
5.  Set up field service so you can accurately track costs and revenues:
