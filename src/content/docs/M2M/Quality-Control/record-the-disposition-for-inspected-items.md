If you record that an item requires rework or scrap, Made2Manage moves that item's job information to the **Disposition of Rework & Scrap** page. To record how you resolved any issues with that job and to account for rework and scrap, you assign disposition.

You assign disposition only to rejected production items.

## To record the disposition for inspected items

1.  Open the **Disposition of Rework & Scrap (DISPRS)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Quality** > **Disposition of Rework & Scrap**.

        Or

    -  Search for **DISPRS** or **Disposition of Rework & Scrap** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Disposition of Rework & Scrap**. <br> The **Disposition of Rework & Scrap (DISPRS)** page appears.

2.  Select the item you need, and then select any one of the options in the **Method Used For Rework or Replacement: (Select a Disposition Type to Save)** section.

    -  If you do not require additional tasks in the job:
    Click **Absorbed in the Job without Any Changes**.

    -  If you changed or will change the existing job's routing by adding the quantity required or an operation for rework: Click **Edited the Job Routing to Reflect Added Work and/or Quantity**.

    -  If the job requires extensive rework and you must assign it to a new job: Click **Create Sub-Job**.

    -  If you assign the rework to an existing job: Click **Assign Rework/Scrap to Job No**.

    1.  Click the **Job No.** Lookup Reference.
 <br>   The **Lookup For Job No.** window appears.
