The Made2Manage–uniPoint integration aids in the flow of Made2Manage transactions data to the uniPoint Quality Management System (QMS). Use the **Quality (CSQUAL)** page to configure Made2Manage for the Made2Manage–uniPoint integration.

>[!Note] You have to perform this configuration only once for each Made2Manage company database. You must also reconfigure the settings when you want to associate another uniPoint database with the Made2Manage company database.

>[!Important] The Made2Manage 8.0–uniPoint integration is a one-way integration. Data flows only from Made2Manage to uniPoint. No data is sent from uniPoint to Made2Manage.

The **Quality (CSQUAL)** page has the following controls:

-   **UniPoint Database**: Type the name of the uniPoint database that you have set up for integration with the current open company.

>[!Important] If uniPoint is installed in a Server that is different from the one in which Made2Manage Server component is installed, prefix the uniPoint database name with the Server path.

-   **UniPoint Folder Path**: Specify the folder in which uniPoint is installed.
-   **Test Connection**: Click this button to verify the configuration settings.
