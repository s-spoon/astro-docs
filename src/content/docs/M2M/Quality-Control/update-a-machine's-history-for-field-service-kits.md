A machine's configuration contains the machine's component history. If you want to change only the machine history and not create a service order or actually ship any parts to the customer site, use the **Field Kit** window.

This is primarily used to reflect activities that occurred prior to the installation of Made2Manage's Field Service module.

If you find errors in a configuration record, you can also change the serial number or any of the related notes only.
