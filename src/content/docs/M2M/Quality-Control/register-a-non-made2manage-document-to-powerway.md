You register documents to binders in Powerway.

Show me which binder types I can use to register a document.

You can register a document to more than one binder. **For example**, you can register a single document to the **Sales Orders** window binder, to the individual sales order binder, and to the customer binder.

Use the **Made2Manage Document Registration** wizard to register the documents to binders. Follow the wizard to set information about the document and to locate the file in the file directory.

## To register a non-Made2Manage document to Powerway

Click the Powerway Quality Binder Document Registration.

1.  In the **Select Document Type** area, highlight the type of document to register.

    Or Highlight **\<Misc>** to register a document that does not fit the predefined document types.

2.  Click **Next**.
3.  Follow the wizard to set information about the document.
    The windows and the fields that appear depend on the document type you select.
