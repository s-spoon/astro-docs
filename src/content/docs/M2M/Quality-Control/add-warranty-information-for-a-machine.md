You can add warranty information for a specific machine to indicate in the system what expenses are billable on service orders.

When you create an active warranty:

-   The system displays the default warranty type in the **Type of Warranty** box. You can change this information on the Warranty tab of the **Machine** page. You can also add a warranty type.
-   You can use **Calculate** button to open the **Payment Calculation** window to calculate a payment amount and link that result to this warranty. The periodic amount is based on the contract amount, the frequency and interest rate to obtain a periodic payment.

    A machine can have only one active warranty.
