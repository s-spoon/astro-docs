1.  Open the **Field Service Control (FSORD)** page.

    - Select **Customer Relationship Management** > **CRM Transactions** > **Field Service** > **Field Service Control**.

    -  Search for **FSORD** or **Field Service Control** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Field Service Control**. <br> The **Field Service Control (FSORD)** page appears.

2.  Click the **Parts Information** tab.
3.  In the grid, select row that contains the part.
4.  Click **Status** drop-down arrow and select **Installed**.
5.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to keep the changes.
