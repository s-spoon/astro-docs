title: "Understanding the Events and Actions Notifier"
draft: false


---

The Events and Actions Notifier was created to allow users to set Made2Manage to perform actions or send alerts whenever a specific event occurs.

The Events and Actions Notifier does not replace the Notifier workflow enabling system. For more information about the Notifier workflow enabling system, see the **.

For example, you can use the Events and Actions Notifier to:

-   Alert salespersons if one of their sales orders is modified.
-   Email customers thanking them when they place an order over \$1,000.00.
-   Export commission data at the end of each month, alert your sales force when the data has been exported, and email your accounts payable manager a reminder to approve monthly commission checks.

Depending on complexity, creating some events and actions may require programming knowledge.
