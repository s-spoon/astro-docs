The Made2Manage Events & Actions tool is integrated with the standard Made2Manage Notifiersâ„¢ and allows you to create various types of enhanced Notifiers in Made2Manage. This tool will help you make quicker, faster business decisions, improve inter-departmental communication and allow you to monitor any business metric. With the Events & Actions tool, you can monitor a wide variety of criteria. For example, events that you can define include all types of orders like:

-   Instances when inventory drops below safety stock.
-   Changes to designated fields anywhere in the system.
-   Shortages in material received for producing jobs.
-   Targets for product quantities shipped to your customer and more.

    You can send these messages to your customers, vendors, or any user in Made2Manage.

    An event is something that takes place in Made2Manage. Closing a sales order, shipping out a part, or creating a customer invoice are all examples of events. Actions are the responses to the events. Those actions can be anything from a message box displayed, an email sent or received, or execution of custom methods.

    Events and actions are company specific. There is no way to share the events and actions between companies. You will need to recreate or copy the events and actions to every other company where you wish to execute them.
