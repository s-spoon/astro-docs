Use the **AR and AP Aging Analysis** report to generate details of the amounts of past due payments by period past due. These include comparisons to prior quarter and year.

You may include invoices created within a specified time period and in all cases, no payment/invoice record will be included which occurred after the aging date. In all cases, this report excludes 'new, unconfirmed' (and in AP, 'Held') invoices.
