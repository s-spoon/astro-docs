An Engineering Change Order (ECO) records information about engineering changes you want to manage. You can change or remove an ECO if you are the ECO's author or if you have author override permissions.

Made2Manage does not notify customer, vendors, or other Made2Manage users when you remove an ECO.

Your system administrator may be the only person who can set permissions.
