Engineering Change Management (ECM) lets you control changes users make to records. However, you can permit users with ECM override permissions to override change control for the documents.

If a user overrides ECM control of an audited record, Made2Manage still tracks the changes you make to the record.

## To set override permissions for ECM control

1.  Open the **Production (CSPROD)** page.
    1.  *Select* **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **Production**.

        Or

    2.  *Search for* **CSPROD** *or* **Production** *in the* **Navigation box** *and then select* **Production**. <br>The **Production (CSPROD)** page appears.

2.  Click the **ECM** tab.
3.  In the **Control Configuration** area, select the **Allow Override** check box for the records that you want to allow employees with ECM override permission to override change control and make changes.
4.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to save the changes.

    Choose how to inform vendors, customers, and Made2Manage users of changes in an engineering change order's status
