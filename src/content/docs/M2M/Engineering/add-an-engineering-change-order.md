An Engineering Change Order (ECO) outlines the proposed change to a part or a document and requests review and approval from the individuals who would be impacted or charged with imple- menting the change. Ideally, you should create an ECO for every change you want to make to a part or a document.

You can add an ECO template if you plan to make the same kind of engineering changes. An ECO tem- plate includes information on which you can base your changes. You can also include a standard list of recipients on the template's broadcast distribution list.
