title: "Set a broadcast distribution list in an engineering change order"
draft: false

---

You can create a list of people you want to inform about changes or progress in an engineering change order (ECO). When you change the status of an ECO, Made2Manage sends a message to the recipients in the ECO's broadcast distribution list. Use the ECO's broadcast distribution list to notify customers, vendors, and Made2Manage users through the Notifier system and/or your company's email system about the engineering changes made. You can customize the broadcast distribution list for each ECO you create.

If you copy an ECO or a template, or if you add an ECO or template from a template, the broadcast distribution list is also carried into the new ECO or ECO template.

Made2Manage notifies customer and vendor contacts by sending email.
