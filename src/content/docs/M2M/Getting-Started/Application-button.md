The **Application** button is in the upper-left corner of the Made2Manage application.

When you click the **Application** button , a menu appears that contains the most accessed items.

The **Exit** button is available on both the **Home** tab and in the **Application**  menu. This enables users to close the application directly from the desired location without going to the **Home** tab.
