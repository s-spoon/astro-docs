Made2Manage can keep separate data sets to store information from more than one company. Each data set is called a company.

You can also use companies to store test data.

**To open a company**

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click **User Preferences**.

   The **Settings** pane appears.

2. Expand **Company** and select the radio button of the required company.

3. A message, *You have selected to switch to Company \<nn>, would you like to open a new tab or refresh the current tab?* appears.

    Click **New** to open the company in a new tab of the browser, or click **Refresh** to open the company in the existing tab of the browser.

    > [!Note] By default, Made2Manage opens the **Home** page when you open a new company.
