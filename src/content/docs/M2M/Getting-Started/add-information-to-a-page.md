You frequently need to add information to Made2Manage. You add quotations, job orders, invoices, bills of material, routings, and more.

These instructions tell you generally how to add information. Help tells you the exact steps to follow in each situation. Press F1 in any page to open Help. 


**To add information**

1. Open the page.

    For example, to add a sales order, open the **Sales Orders (SO)** page. 

2. On the **Toolbar**, click **New**.

    Or click **Copy** to base the new information on the information that the selected option populates in the page.

3. Type the information. To move from one field to another, press the Tab key. Or, click in the field to populate the field with the current value.

    When you click a Lookup Reference at the end of a field, a window appears from which you can select a record.

4. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to keep the information.
