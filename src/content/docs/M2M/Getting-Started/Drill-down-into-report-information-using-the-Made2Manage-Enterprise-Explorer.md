If you want to explore the information related to a report's output, you can drill down into report results using the **Explore**.

An option you purchase separately, the **Explore** lets you launch the Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer and explore the **relationships between documents**, **check the status of any document**, and get a **quick summary of the document's** **contents**.


**To drill down into report information using the Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer**

1. Open the **Report** page for the report you want to run.

2. Click the **Run Now** to run the report now, or select **More Actions** > **Actions** > **Schedule** to schedule the report to be run on a later date.
