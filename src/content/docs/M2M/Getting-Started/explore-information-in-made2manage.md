Use the **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** page to explore the relationships between documents, check the status of any document, and get a quick summary of the document's content. You can also open documents from the Explorer.

When you drill-down in the **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** page, you can only view the referenced information. The reference information is based on:

- Related pages

- Dependent pages

- Child tables

- Lookups

For example, you can drill down to a Sales Order from a Customer only if at least one Sales Order exists for the Customer. From the Sales Order, you can drill-down and identify the linked information such as the customer payment terms and salesperson details, and related pages such as Sales Order Line Items. From a Sales Order Line Item, you can drill-down to view the related pages such as Sales Order Detailed BOM and Sales Order Releases.

When you drill-down in the **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** page, you cannot view columns added in the parent level table.

For example, if you had added a **Quantity Available** column in the **INMAST** table through the **DICT** page, and drill-down **INVOH** records in the **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** page to the **Inventory Locations** table via **Item Master**, you cannot view the **Quantity Available** column in the **Inventory Locations** grid as that is a part of the **Item Master** records and not **Inventory Location**.

That is, you cannot identify the quantity available in each location by drilling down in the **Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer (EXPLOR)** page from **INVOH**.
