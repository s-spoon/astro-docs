A supply and demand comparison that identifies how much of the supply plan is truly excess supply at the end of the planning horizon. There are two AVL codes available: AVL (Sales Order) and AVL (Forecast). The AVL calculation is based on the PAB values over the planning horizon. For example, if the PAB values for the current and future periods/dates are positive, then the current AVL is equal to the lowest of the PAB values within the planning horizon. If the PAB value in the current period/date is negative, then the current AVL is equal to the current negative PAB value. If the PAB value for the current period/date is positive, and the PAB for any future period is negative, then the current AVL is zero. This comparison is a cumulative (across periods) ATP value.

**grace period**

1. A feature of Made2Manage bar code that adjusts clock ins and clock outs for times you specify. For example, you can set a grace period that moves clock ins that occur between 7:15 and 7:35 to 7:30. This way, early workers can clock in upon arrival but still be paid only from the shift's start, and late workers' pay won't be docked unless they're more than five minutes late.

2. The Internal Use "Grace Period" used by the system when calculating any 'payment terms' discount amount. If a discount percent exists and the transaction date is on or before (Invoice Date + Number of Days + Grace Period Days), the system will calculate a discount amount and consider that the payment was made within terms.

For example, if your Grace Period is two days, this would allow you to accept a cash discount which was processed on the 12th for an invoice which was to be paid by the 10th as still being within the stated invoice terms, but rejecting as "unearned" any payments processed on the 13th or after for invoices whose discount expired on the 10th.
