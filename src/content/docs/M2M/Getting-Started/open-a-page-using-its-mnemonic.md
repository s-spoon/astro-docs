Most pages have a mnemonic that you can use to open the page quickly.

You can also use the mnemonic to determine if a page contains any modifications or customizations.

**To open a page using its mnemonic**

1. In the **Global Search** box, type the mnemonic.

    Or

    In the **Navigation** box, type the mnemonic.

2. Scroll down the list of pages, and select the page to open.

    Or quickly type the mnemonic.

    Type fast. If you delay more than one second between letters, Made2Manage assumes you want to start over. So if you want to find the **AR Aging Status (RPARAG)** page but pause for one second between typing **R** and **P**, you will settle on the **Part/Location Labels (PARTLA)** page.
