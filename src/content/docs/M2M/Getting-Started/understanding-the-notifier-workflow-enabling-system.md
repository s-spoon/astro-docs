The Notifier system helps you manage your workflow by automatically sending messages to you, other employees, customers, or vendors when certain events occur. For example, you can add a Notifier event to let the sales manager know when a particular sale closes or to let a customer know when their order ships.

You can add a Notifier event for a quotation, purchase order, job order, sales order, shipper, receiver, accounts payable invoice, and accounts receivable invoice. You can also add Notifier events that occur on a particular date. A Notifier message can be a pop-up window, fax, or email.

To set up more detailed Notifier events and actions, use the **Events and Actions Notifier**.
