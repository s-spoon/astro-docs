The best method for automatically launching a window at startup is to enable the option **Preload Screen at Startup**. The option is listed only when you add a window to **Favorites** using the **Add to Favorites** option.


**To automatically open a window when you start Made2Manage**

Add the form to the Favorites tab if it is not there already

1. Click the **Favorites** tab and select **Preload Screen at Startup**.

   If selected, you will find a checkmark next to this option

2. Click **Close** on the **Ribbon** to exit from the screen and log out for the changes to take effect.

   You will see the applications open automatically at startup.

   For Made2Manage to no longer automatically open this window, repeat these steps and click the **No** in this step.
