The **Filter Editor** allows you to build complex filter criteria with an unlimited number of filter conditions, combined by logical operators.

**Tree-Like Filter Editing Style**

You can invoke the **Filter Editor** using the **Edit Filter** , which is displayed within the filter panel or through the Column Header Context Menu (Right-click any column's header and select Filter Editor). The Filter Editor is also invoked when choosing the (Custom...) item from the filter drop-down, provided that the Custom Filter Dialog cannot display the column's current filter criteria in its entirety.

The **Filter Editor** displays filter criteria as a tree structure, where nodes represent simple filter conditions. If the filter criteria consist of multiple filter conditions, the Filter Editor contains multiple nodes linked by logical operators into groups.

Conditions combined by a logical operator at the same level form a **group**. You can think of groups as clauses wrapped by round brackets in the filter expression. There is only one group in the example above.

Click **Add Group** to combine two logical operators.
