If you have opened more than one window on your Made2Manage desktop, the one in which you are currently working is considered the active window.

To make any open window active, click it. Or open the **Transfer** window and select the window from the list.

> [!Note]   
If you maximize a window on your Made2Manage desktop and toggle to any other opened window, the other window also appears in the maximized view.  
If you minimize one of the multiple windows open on your Made2Manage desktop, the view of the other open windows remains unchanged.
