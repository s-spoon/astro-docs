When you're looking for a particular document and remember some of the details about it, search for it. For example, search for the salesperson details when you remember a part of the salesperson's name.

**To search for information**

1. Open the required page.

    For example, open the **Salesperson (SLPN)** page.

2. On the **Toolbar**, click **Search**.

3. Several fields on the page become editable. Type what you know about the record you are looking for in the relevant fields.

    For example, if you remember the name of the salesperson, type the first letters of the salesperson's name in the appropriate field.

    Type '**_**' to match on any single character or **%** to match on any set of characters. For example, if you type **T_M** in the **Name** field and search, the search results show **TIM** and **TOM**, but not **TOD**. Type **T%** and search to show all names that start with **T** such as **TIM**, **TOM**, and **TOD**.

4. On the **Toolbar**, click **Search**.

    If the search finds more than one match, a Browse window appears and lists all the matches. Double-click the record that you require.

    Date fields in the search window use your operating system's date format settings.
