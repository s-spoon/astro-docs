When you add or change information on a page, fields in which you type numbers have special behavior.

Numeric fields differ in appearance based on their data type. Numeric fields with decimal data type have an icon at the end of the field, and resemble a combo box. Numeric fields with integer data type appear as a spin box.

There are three ways to enter a number in a numeric field:

- Type the number.

    Or

- Click the icon at the end of the numeric field to display the **Calculator**. Enter the required value.

    Or

- Click the up or down arrow to increase or decrease the value in the field.
