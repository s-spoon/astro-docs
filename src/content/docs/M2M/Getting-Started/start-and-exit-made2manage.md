The first step to doing anything in Made2Manage is to sign in.

**To sign in to Made2Manage**

1. Click on the URL to open the sign-in page.

2. If the system asks you for your **Username**, **Password**, and **Tenant Name**, get them from your system administrator.

    a. In the **Username** box, type your username.

    b. In the **Password** box, type your password.

    c. In the **Tenant Name** box, type your tenant's name.

3. Click **Sign in**.

    If the system does not ask you for your username and password, it means that Made2Manage automatically signed you in. This happens when you have recently signed in to Made2Manage on a different tab on the same browser.

- Type **Alt+O**.

    Or

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, click **User Preferences**.
