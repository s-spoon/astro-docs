You configure most reports and direct their output using the  **Parameters** list.

Most of the time, you will use default report layouts and send the report to the browser or the printer.

**You can use some advanced report features**

1. You can add filters to reports to limit their output.

2. You can schedule a report to run later.

3. You can email the report to someone.

4. You can fax the report to someone.

5. You can save your settings so you can run the same report again quickly.

6. You can drill down into report information using the Made2Manage Enterprise Explorer.
