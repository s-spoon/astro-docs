You can merge information from your reports into any Microsoft Word document. You do not have to create a Word document before running the merge process. Also, you must shut down Word before doing the merge. And merging only works with special document reports.

To use mail merge, your system administrator must set you up as an advanced user in Made2Manage.

To successfully merge information, you need to know which Made2Manage database fields correspond to which information. For information, see the related information. You must also set up your Word document to include fields into which Word can merge your report's information. See Microsoft Word Help for information.
