Regardless of the interface you see when you run a report, the steps are similar. To get specific steps, open the report's page and press **F1**.

**To run a report**

1. Open the report's page.

2. Select the information to show and how to show it:

    a. In the **Selection** list, select the information to include in the report.

    b. In the **Sort Order** list, select how to sort the report.

    c. In the **Copy** list, select the copy to generate, if the report has multiple copies.

    For example, for an accounts receivable report, the choices might be **All Copies**, **Accounting Copy**, and **Vendor Copy**.

    d. In the **Layout** list, select the report's layout, if the report has multiple layouts.

    e. In the **Parameters** list, select the parameter to use, if required.

    Selecting a parameter set changes all your other choices on this page. To save parameter sets, see the **.

    f. For reports that use the **General Ledger Report Parameters Interface**:

    - In the **Rounding and Negative** fields, select how to round and show negative numbers.

    - In the **Include** fields, select the columns to include.

        To include a column, select its check box.

3. Select how much information to include in the report:

    a. If the **Date Range** area is displayed, type a range of dates to include on the report.

    > [!TIP] Leave the **From** and **To** fields blank to include all dates.

    > [!TIP] In the **Fill Dates** list, select the appropriate option to use a predefined range of dates.

    b. If the **Sort Range** list is displayed, select the range of information to include in the report:

    - Click **Single** and type a value in the **From** field, to include only one item.

    - Click **Range** and type the first and last values in the **From** and **To** fields, to include a range of items.

    - Click **All** to include all items.

    > [!Note] The kind of information to include is displayed in the **Sort On** field.

    c. If the **Advanced Filter** button is enabled, click it to further limit the information to include.

    For more information, see the **.

    d. Select the **Summary** check box, if it is displayed, to generate only a summary of the report's information.

4. Click **Printer Setup**, to select printer settings.

5. If the **Other Variables** section is displayed, specify appropriate values.

6. On the **Toolbar**, click one of the output options to generate the report.

    > [!Note] If a specific printer is set up to be used for a report copy and if the workstation does not have access to that printer, the error message, *Unable to print. The printer is not listed as an available printer on the workstation. Would you like to use the workstation's default printer?* appears while trying to print a report for that copy. 
    > Click **Yes** to use the default printer to print the report copy.
    > Click **No** to abort printing the report copy. If all copies are being printed, clicking **No** will try to print the next report copy.

    > [!Note] If no printers are added to the workstation, the error message, *No printers are installed.* appears while trying to print a report. Add a printer to the workstation, set up the report printer settings to use the added printer, and then retry printing the report.
