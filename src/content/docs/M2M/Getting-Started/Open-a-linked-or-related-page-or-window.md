To open a linked page, on the **Toolbar**, click **More Actions**. Then select **More Actions** > **Related**, and select the page to open.

When you open a linked page, the page opens with information from the page from which you opened it. **For example**, when you look at a quotation in the **Quotes (QUOTE)** page, you can open the related **Accounts (CUST)** page. The **Accounts** page opens with information about the customer in the **Quotes** page.
