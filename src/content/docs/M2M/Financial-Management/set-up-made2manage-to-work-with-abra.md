title: "Set up Made2Manage to work with Abra"
draft: false


---

Made2Manage works with Sage HRMS that was formerly called Abra. After you install Sage HRMS and after your finance manager sets up the necessary General Ledger chart of accounts numbers, configure Made2Manage to work with Abra.

Sage Abra 9.x uses Visual FoxPro (VFP) for storing and managing its data. So, in Made2Manage you only have to specify where the Abra VFP database files are located and the three character ID of the company in Abra that is integrated with Made2Manage.

The latest version of Sage Abra called Sage HRMS has migrated the data stored in the VFP data- base to the SQL Server database. So, you must specify the Abra SQL Server details in Made2Manage for proper integration.
