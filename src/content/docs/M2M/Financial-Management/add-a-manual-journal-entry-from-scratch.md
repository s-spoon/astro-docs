Made2Manage records most transactions in the four subledgers. But certain transactions, such as filling the petty cash box, making corrections, and making adjustments at period-end, require manual journal entries. Manual journal entries post directly to the general ledger.

To distribute a posting from one account to others by pre-assigned percentages: First, set up an automatic journal entry distribution (see the **). Then, to apply the distribution, make a manual journal entry.

To set up a journal entry that automatically recurs, first make a manual journal entry. Then specify the recurrence. See the [Related Information]().
