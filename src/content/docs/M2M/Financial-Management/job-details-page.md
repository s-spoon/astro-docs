draft: false


---

The **Job Details - `<job number>`** page shows all costs associated with an individual job order. The page also shows the details of the job order.

The summary grid shows the total of the various types of costs. The page divides these costs into **actual**, **estimated**, and **standard** costs. Along with the total costs, the summary grid also shows unit costs.

The summary grid shows the following types of costs:

- Material
- Sub Contracting
- Setup
- Labor
- Overhead

The lower part of the page contains the **Materials** and the **Labor/Sub Contracting** tabs. Click these tabs to see the grids under the corresponding section.

> **Note**: All job orders may not have a Sub Contracting section.

The grid under the **Materials** section shows estimated and actual material and overhead costs for each part. The grid arranges these costs by facility ID. The grid under the **Labor** section shows the total estimated and actual costs for each operation. It also shows the total estimated and actual hours, and the percentage of actual to estimated hours and cost. The grid under the **Sub Contracting** section shows the estimated and actual costs and a percentage of the actual to estimated cost for each operation.

Each job order in the **Margin Analyzer (MRGANLZ)** page is linked to its own **Job Details - `<job number>`** page.
