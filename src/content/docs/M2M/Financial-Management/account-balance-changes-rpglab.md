Use the **Account Balance Changes** report to generate General Ledger data for:

-   End of month account balances for two periods chosen by the user.
-   The change between the two periods.

[!Note]  
CHOOSING PERIODS TO COMPARE---Enter any date within EACH period to compare.

The balances displayed will ALWAYS be for the END of periods chosen.

- No report will be produced if EITHER period has ALL zero balances. Use balance sheet or income statement to get statements with no changes.

- When ENTERING ACCOUNT NUMBERS, do NOT include dashes (-).

- Changes for revenue and expense accounts will be meaningful ONLY within a single fiscal year because their amounts are zero at the beginning of each fiscal year

By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use **Advanced Filters** to customize or expand your filter criteria. For more information about **Advanced Filters**, click here.
