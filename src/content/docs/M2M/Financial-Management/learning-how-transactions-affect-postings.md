| **Status**     | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Open           | You did not transfer the remaining balance in the landed costs clearing account to the purchase price variance account. You can still reconcile the difference between estimated and actual landed costs for the item. |
| Closed         | You already transferred the balance in the landed costs clearing account to the purchase price variance account.                                                                                                       |
| Not applicable | The receiver does not contain items with landed costs.                                                                                                                                                                 |
