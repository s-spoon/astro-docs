Use the **Salesperson Performance** report to generate order volume for the past 3, 6, 12, and 24 month periods. Sort the report by the salesperson's initials or name, territory, sales code, sold-to state or city, or the product class. The purpose of this report is to provide information for comparing performance among salespersons, performance in different geographic areas, and performance among product classes.
