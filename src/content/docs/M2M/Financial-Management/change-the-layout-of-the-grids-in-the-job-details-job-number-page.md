The **Job Details - \<job number\>** page has tools that help you to modify the layout, and then export job-order data.

By changing the layout of the grids, you can control the visibility of the grids’ columns, and format the rows and cells of the grids. You can then save a layout and load it to see a custom view of the grids.

Export a job order’s data to a Microsoft Excel workbook. The workbook stores the grid data of the **Materials**, **Labor**, and **Sub Contracting** sections in respective worksheets.
