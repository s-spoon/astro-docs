The **Margin Analyzer (MRGANLZ)** page shows column charts and pie charts. These charts represent the different type of costs associated with the job order. Depending on the grouping option you use to group the job orders, both charts show the cost data for the value of the selected grouping option. For example, if you group job orders using the **By Customer** option, the bar chart shows data according to customer.

The column chart shows the total actual, estimated, and standard costs of the grouping option. Point to a column, and Made2Manage shows a pop-up window that contains the costs’ values and the grouping option’s value. The column chart appears below the grid in the **Margin Analyzer (MRGANLZ)** page. Drag the colored bar at the top of the chart to increase the values on the y-axis and consequently increase the column lengths.

To view the column chart, on the toolbar, click **Chart**. To stop showing the chart, click **Chart** again.

The pie chart shows further details about the actual, estimated, and standard costs. Made2Manage picks up these costs from the **Summary** grid in the **Job Details** page of a job order. You can see the total Labor, Material, Other, Overhead, Setup, Sub Contracting, and Tool costs. The system shows these costs for the actual, estimated, and standard costs. In the **Margin Analyzer (MRGANLZ)** page, point to the values in either the **Cost (act)**, **Cost (est)**, or **Cost (STD)** columns to see the pie chart. The system shows the chart for individual job orders and totals of all job orders for the value of the selected grouping option.

> [!Note] Click a job order to open its **Job Details - \<job number\> page** and see the job order’s details and its cost details

To view the pie chart, on the toolbar, click **Show Detail Costs**, and then point to any value in either the **Cost (act)**, **Cost (est)**, or **Cost (STD)** columns. To stop showing the chart, click **Show Detail Costs** again.
