The chart of accounts includes all the general ledger accounts. It organizes accounts by category. Some accounts are sub-accounts of other accounts. Made2Manage comes with six permanent account categories:

-   Assets
-   Cost of goods sold
-   Expenses
-   Liabilities
-   Revenue from sales
-   Shareholders' equity

If your company has multiple facilities, add accounts for each facility.
