The work center calendar shows a particular work center's shifts and working hours. For scheduling, the working time in the work center calendar overrides the working time in the production calendar. You can add a month to a work center's calendar at any time. You can remove past months, so the schedule generates faster.

After you add a month, set shifts for the work center in that month. See the related information. To add a work center
