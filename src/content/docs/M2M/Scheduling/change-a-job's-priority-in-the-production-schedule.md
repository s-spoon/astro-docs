    The **Browse For Modify Job Schedule/Status** window appears.

3. Select the row that contains the job order whose priority you want to change, and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row that contains the job order whose priority you want to change.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Browse For Modify Job Schedule/Status** window.

4. In the **Priority** box, type or select a value for the job's new priority.

    A lesser number gives the job a higher priority; a greater number gives it a lower priority.
