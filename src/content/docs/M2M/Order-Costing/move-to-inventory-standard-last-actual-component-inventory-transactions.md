When you move to finished goods, Made2Manage reduces the quantity in process for the parent part by the amount moved to inventory, increases the quantity on hand, increases month-to-date and year-to-date receipts, and updates the quantity available.

Made2Manage updates the unit average cost using this calculation:

(current unit average x quantity on hand) + (job actual cost x quantity moved to finished goods)  
new on-hand quantity

The job actual costs include subjobs. If the quantity on hand is negative, Made2Manage views on-hand as zero.
