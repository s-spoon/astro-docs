 \*If you do not move anything to finished goods, this amount is actual costs minus estimates.

When you close a job, Made2Manage updates the last actual cost with the job's actual cost. Also, if a subjob exists, Made2Manage updates the subjob parent part's last actual cost with the subjob's total actual cost.
