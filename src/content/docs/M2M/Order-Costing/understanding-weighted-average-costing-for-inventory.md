Weighted average costing means that your company bases costs on information from purchase orders and estimates for a job order. For purchase orders, Made2Manage adjusts costs when you receive the items into inventory. For job orders, Made2Manage adjusts its costs depending on the type of item. Made2Manage calculates costs as follows:

**[(Quantity on hand × unit average cost) + (Quantity received × PO price)] / new on-hand quantity**

Here's an example of how a purchase order could affect weighted average inventory costing. If you ordered five motors at \$20 and later placed a purchase order for five more motors at \$25, Made2Manage would calculate the average cost for those motors at \$22.50. That cost takes effect when you receive all items on both purchase orders into inventory.
