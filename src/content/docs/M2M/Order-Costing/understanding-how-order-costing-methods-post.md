It is often helpful to understand how order-costing methods post to the general ledger. The way these methods post depends upon how you have order, inventory, and estimate costing set up in Made2Manage.

If you don’t know your setup, check the **Production (CSPROD)** page. See "Set costing rules" in the related information.

Find your costing configuration in the following table. Click **Posting info** at the end of that row for explanations about postings in your costing configuration.
