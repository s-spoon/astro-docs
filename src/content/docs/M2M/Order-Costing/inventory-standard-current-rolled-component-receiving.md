**Made2Manage uses this calculation to update the weighted-average cost column and unit average cost (if current on-hand is negative, Made2Manage views on-hand as zero quantity):

(current weighted average x current on-hand) + (purchase order cost x quantity received)  
current on-hand + quanitity received
