Using Made2Manage you can accept credit card payments from customers. Made2Manage allows you to process immediate credit card payments and authorize credit card payments. You have to store the credit card details of the customer to process the credit card payments. Use the **Credit Card Inform- ation (CCINFO)** window to add and view credit card details of a customer. You can open this page from the **Accounts (CUST)** page.
