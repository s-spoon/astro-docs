Use the **AR Aging Status** report to generate Accounts Receivable aging, forecasting, and status reports that help you monitor payments received from customers to:

-   Alert you to late payments.
-   Forecast cash.

You can enter an aging date prior to today's date if desired. This will produce a report that ignores all activity after the date you input. The report excludes the following:

-   Invoices with invoice dates after the date entered.
-   Payments on invoices made after the date entered.

    By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use **Advanced Filters** to cus- tomize or expand your filter criteria. For more information about **Advanced Filters**, click here.
