When a customer fails to pay or exceeds the credit limit, you can set the customer status to poor standing. Restore the customer to good standing when the customer pays the balance due.

-   When you enable credit hold, Made2Manage prevents sales and shipments to cus- tomers and distributors in poor standing.
-   When you disable credit hold, Made2Manage just warns others when they sell or ship to customers and distributors in poor standing.

    To enable or disable credit hold, see the Related Information.
