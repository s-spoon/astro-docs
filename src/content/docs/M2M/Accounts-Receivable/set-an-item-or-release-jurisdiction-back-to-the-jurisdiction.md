If you change the jurisdiction for an item or a release on a purchase order, sales order, quotation, or invoice, you can set it to the original jurisdiction to accommodate varying customer or vendor tax needs.

You can change a jurisdiction for a document, or an item or release on a document, only if you use geography-based taxes.

You can change the jurisdiction on an invoice only when the invoice is new or unpaid.
