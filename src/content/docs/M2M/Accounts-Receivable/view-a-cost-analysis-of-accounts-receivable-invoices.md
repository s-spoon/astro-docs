Use the **Cost Analysis Report** page as an analysis tool which reflects invoiced sales from shippers.

-   Miscellaneous invoices and credit memos are not included in total sales.
-   This report is not designed to be a reconciling tool.

    If items are make, costs are estimated from the job. If items are stock, costs are based on the invent- ory costing method from the item master. Invoices from sales orders may include items that are not shipped; all invoices from sales orders will pull costs from the Sales Order Price Summary.

    By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use **Advanced Filters** to cus- tomize or expand your filter criteria. For more information on **Advanced Filters**, click here.
