You can change or remove a sales tax code at any time.

When you remove a sales tax code from existing sales orders , purchase orders , or quotations, the tax rate on those forms returns to zero percent. This is not true, however, for existing invoices.

To open the sales tax code

1.  Open the **Sales Tax (SLTAX)** page.
1.  *Select* **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Finance** > **Sales Tax**.

    Or

    *Search for* **SLTAX** *or* **Sales Tax** *in the* **Navigation box** *and then select* **Sales Tax**.

    **Sales Tax (SLTAX)** *page appears.*

2.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Browse**.

    The **Browse For Sales Tax** window appears.

    To add a new rate to the sales tax code

2.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Copy**.
3.  In the **Tax Rate (%)** field, type the new rate percentage.

    When you save the new record, the system will calculate an effective 'To' date for the original record. This date will be the day prior to the start date of the new tax rate. The system determines the tax rate to use on an AP/ARInvoice by matching the invoice tax point date to the effective sales tax date range.
