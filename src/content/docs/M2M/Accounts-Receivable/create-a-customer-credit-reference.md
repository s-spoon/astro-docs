-   The company's payment terms.
-   The amount of credit you extend to the customer.
-   The date the customer last purchased material from you.
-   The amount of money the customer currently owes you.
-   The average number of days it takes the customer to pay you after billing.

    Blank lines are provided at the bottom of the letter to enable the authorized individual to fill the fol- lowing information: **Authorized Signature**, **Date Signed**, **Position/Title**, and **Company Name**.
