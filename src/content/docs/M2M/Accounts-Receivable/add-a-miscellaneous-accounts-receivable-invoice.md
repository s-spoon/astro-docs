Add a miscellaneous invoice when you want to bill a customer for items not on a sales order or ship- per.

To add a miscellaneous accounts receivable invoice

1.  Open the **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo (ARINV)** page.

Select Financial Management > Financial Transactions > Accounts Receivable > Customer Invoices & Credit Memo.

Or

1.  *Search for* **ARINV** *or* **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo** *in the* **Navigation box** *and then select* **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo**.

    **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo (ARINV)** *page appears.*

2.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Copy**.
3.  Select **Miscellaneous Invoice** > **Customer**. The **Copying Customer** window appears.
4.  Highlight a row and click **Select**.
5.  Click the **Order Info** tab.
6.  Click the **Sold To Address Key** lookup reference button. The **Lookup For Sold To Address Key** window appears.
7.  Highlight a row and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row to select.
8.  For handwritten invoices:

    » Select the **Hand Written Invoice** check box.

    » If necessary, in the **Invoice Number** field, type the invoice num- ber.

9.  If the **Apply Prepayments** is not disabled, the customer has prepaid some or all of the sales order. To apply the prepayments:
1.  Click **Apply Prepayments**.
    1.  Review the prepayments.
1.  In the **Apply Now** column for each prepayment, type the amount to apply to this invoice.

        Made2Manage applies the prepayment and changes its status to partially paid or fully paid, as appropriate.

    Made2Manage immediately posts handwritten invoices to the general ledger. The next step is to add items.

    After you add items, to change the invoice's status to unpaid, see ["Confirm invoices and credit memo"](confirm-invoices-and-credit-memos.md) . You can do this immediately or after you create many invoices.
