When a customer or vendor pays a different group of taxes than that included in the jurisdiction on a document, you must add the new jurisdiction to documents for that customer or vendor , or to an item or release on documents for that customer or vendor.

You can change a jurisdiction for a document, or an item or release on a document, only if you use geographic-based taxes.

You can change the jurisdiction on an invoice only when the invoice is new or unpaid.

When you change a document's jurisdiction, Made2Manage changes the jurisdiction for any of the document's items or releases that share that jurisdiction.
