You can enter new invoice remarks or shipper remarks in the **Invoice Remarks** tab of the **Accounts Receivable (CSAR)** page instead of modifying the **Invoice & Credit Memo Docu- ment (RPINV)** page, which would add invoice remarks for all company databases.

You can also set an invoice remark as the default invoice remark. The default invoice remark is auto- matically pulled into the invoice in the **Customer Invoice & Credit Memo (ARINV)** page.

To add default remarks to all accounts receiv- able invoices

1.  Open the **Accounts Receivable (CSAR)** page.

Select Utilities > Company Setup > Module Setup > Accounts Receivable.

Or

1.  *Search for* **CSAR** *or* **Accounts Receivable** *in the* **Navigation box** *and then select* **Accounts Receivable**.

    **Accounts Receivable (CSAR)** *page appears.*

2.  Click the **Invoice Remarks** tab.
3.  On the grid toolbar, click **New**.

    You can have more than one set of remarks for each company. The remarks added are displayed in a grid.

4.  In the respective columns, type the remark identifier and its description.
5.  To set the remark as the default remark, select the **Default** check box.
6.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**.

    After you add a new remark in the **Accounts Receivable (CSAR)** page, you can pull any of the remarks added into the invoice in the **Customer Invoice & Credit Memo (ARINV)** window. By default, the remark marked as the default remark is automatically pulled into the invoice in the **Customer Invoice & Credit Memo (ARINV)** window.
