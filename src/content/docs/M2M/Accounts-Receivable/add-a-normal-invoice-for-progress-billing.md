You can create invoices against the progress billing schedule. You add an invoice for a progress billing item on a sales order or quotation. When you are ready to bill the customer for final payment, you can also create a final invoice for progress billing.

If you create an invoice for time and materials billing or percent complete billing, at least one job must exist that has been created from the related sales order release that has some costs applied to it that have not yet been invoiced. The total cost must be greater than zero.

The system creates a separate miscellaneous line item for rounding adjustments to ensure that the invoice amount matches the progress billing amount. This line item does not show up on the actual printed invoice.
