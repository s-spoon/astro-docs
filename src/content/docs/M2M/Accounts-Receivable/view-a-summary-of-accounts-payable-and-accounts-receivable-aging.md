Use the **AR and AP Aging Analysis** report to generate details of the amounts of past due payments by period past due. These include comparisons to prior quarter and year.

You may include invoices created within a specified time period and in all cases, no payment/invoice record will be included which occurred after the aging date. In all cases, this report excludes 'new, unconfirmed' (and in AP, 'Held') invoices.

By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use **Advanced Filters** to cus- tomize or expand your filter criteria. For more information about **Advanced Filters**, click here.
