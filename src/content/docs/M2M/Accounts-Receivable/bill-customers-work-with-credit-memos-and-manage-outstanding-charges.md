When you ship goods to a customer, you send an invoice that describes the items and the payment terms. When a customer returns goods to you or overpays, you can issue a credit memo which can be used against future purchases for the amount you owe. When customers delay their payments, you can add finance charges, send reminder statements, and even place customers on hold or prevent them from ordering more goods from you.
