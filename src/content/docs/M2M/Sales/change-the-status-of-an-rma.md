### To change the Status of RMA:

1. Click the **General** tab.  
2. Click on the **Status** drop-down button to change the status.  
3. To set up the status
   - **Ready for Credit:**  
     - This is a manual status indicating that a credit memo can be created for the RMA. When an RMA is changed to this status, it will appear in the "RMAâ€™s Ready for Invoicing" queue.  The status changes to **Closed** after a credit memo is created. 
     

   - **Cancelled:**  
     - If any transactions have been completed for the RMA, it cannot be deleted. However, the status can be changed to **Cancelled**.  When canceling an RMA, any related Sales Order (SO) and/or Job Order (JO) will also be automatically canceled.
     - A warning message will appear:  
       - *No further transactions will be allowed for a closed or cancelled RMA.*  
   - The status options **Started**, **Open**, **Ready for Credit**, **Cancelled**, and **Closed** are enabled based on the selection of instructions in the **Items** tab.  

4. Change the status of the RMA from Started to Open.
   By default, the **Open** status is selected.  
5. Click **Proceed** to accept the changes.  
   Or click **Cancel** to exit without saving.
