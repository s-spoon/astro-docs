When you enter a quotation or sales order, you can adjust gross profit and determine the pricing you need to achieve your profit margin. When you change costs or prices and the gross profit percentage changes, you can adjust gross profit and recalculate the pricing you need to achieve the gross profit you want.

**To adjust gross profit**

1. Open the quotation or sales order.

2. Click the **Items** tab and select the required row or item.

3. Open the **Sales Order Price Summary** (**SOPSUM**) or **Quote Price Summary** (**QTPSUM**) window:

    a. Click the ellipsis under the **Action** column.

    b. Select **Grid Accessories** > **Grid Actions** > **Price Summary**.

    The **Sales Order Price Summary** or **Quote Price Summary** window appears.

4. If you want to manually change costs or prices, make the adjustments as necessary.

5. To update the costs and prices with changes you made elsewhere in Made2Manage, click **Recalculate** on the child toolbar.

    A message, *This will remove any manual changes that have been made to the % adjustment on the item or on any of the releases of this item. Do you wish to continue?* appears.

6. Click **Yes** to recalculate costs.

    Or click **No** to retain changes.
