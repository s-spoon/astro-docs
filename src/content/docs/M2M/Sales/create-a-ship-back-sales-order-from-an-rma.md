You can create a Ship Back Sales Order from an RMA through Copy.

This is designed to be used in **Rework and return**, **Credit and replace** and **Replace only** scenarios. The items do not have to be received before the replacement and/or rework SO being created.

When creating the ship back SO the **Customer PO Number** on the SO will default to the RMA number with an “R” appended.

You can add new parts to a **Ship Back Sales Order** when parts are returned for replacement/rework or repair.
