Before you take orders or write quotations, set contact information for your customers and prospects.

### To set contact information for customer or prospect:

1. Open the **Account Contacts (CRMCONT)** page.  
2. Add a contact.  
3. Add phone and web information.  
4. Add address and job title information.  
5. On the toolbar, click **Save** to keep the contact.  

   The **Created Date/Time**, **Owner**, **Contact**, **Subject**, **From Type**, and **From No** fields will be filled in with the respective details when the activity is saved. For new activities, the **Modified Date** field will update to show the last date and time the activity was modified, which, in this case, is the same as the **Created Date**.  

For more information, see **Adding an Activity**.
