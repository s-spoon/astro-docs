The **Commissions Payable** form lists commissions with **Unpaid**, **Partially Paid**, or **Paid in Full** status for accounts receivable invoices. Once a commission is paid, it no longer appears in the list.


### To review sales commissions for accounts receivable invoice:

1. Open the **Commission Payable (COMPAY)** page. 
2. All payable commissions are shown in the grid at the top of the screen. You can group this information to make it easier to work with:  
   - **Filter by Type:**  
     - Click the filter in the **Type** column and select the group of sales personnel whose commissions you want to view.  
     The default is set to view **All**, but you can also select to view commissions for only **Internal** employees or **External** personnel.  
   - **Sort by Column:**  
     - Click any of the column headings in the grid to re-display the commission records in order by that column.  
3. To view more details about a commission record, click on a particular row in the grid.  The record details appear at the bottom half of the form.
