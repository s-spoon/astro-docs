The detailed bill of material lists all the parts and assemblies needed to produce a part. For parts that do not already have a standard bill of material, you can add a detailed bill of material to your quotations and sales orders.

**To add detailed bill of material**

1. Open the quotation or sales order.

2. Add the detailed bill:

    a. Click the **Items** tab.

    b. In the grid, select the row that contains the item.

    c. Click the ellipsis under the **Action** column.

    d. Select **Grid Actions** > **Detailed Bill of Material**.

    The **Sales Order Detailed BOM** or **Quote Detailed Bill of Material** page appears.

3. Select the line before which to add the component.

4. Add a part:

    - [Add a part from scratch]()

    - [Add a part based on the highlighted item, a job order, or an item in an estimate file]()

5. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**.

6. Repeat **steps 4 and 5** for each part or assembly to add.
