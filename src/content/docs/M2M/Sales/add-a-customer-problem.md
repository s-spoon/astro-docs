When a customer has a problem with an order, record the problem in Made2Manage to track the problem resolution progress.

**To add customer problem**

1. Open the **Customer Service Inquiry (CRMCSR)** page.

    a. Select **Sales Management** > **Sales Transactions** > **Customer Service Inquiry**.

    b. Search for **CRMCSR** or **Customer Service Inquiry** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Customer Service Inquiry**.

    The **Customer Service Inquiry (CRMCSR)** page appears.

2. On the toolbar, click **New**.

    The following fields are **Read only**:

    - **Inquiry No**: Displays the Inquiry number. Document sequence number for the inquiry which is automatically generated by the system.

    - **Customer Status**: Displays the customer status.

3. In the **Category** dropdown, select the inquiry category.

4. In the **Class** dropdown, select the inquiry class.

    Click **Edit Class** or **Edit Category** from the list.

    The **Popup Table Maintenance (POPUP)** for the respective fields (**Category** and **Class**) appears. You can either add a new value or modify the existing value.

5. Identify the [customer]() and [sales order]():

    - Click the **Customer Number** lookup reference and double-click the account.

    - Click the **Contact** lookup reference and double-click the contact for this inquiry.

    Displays the primary contact's first and last names. If the contact has an email address, an **email** icon appears. Click the icon to open the **Email** window.

    Only contacts filtered by the account are displayed.

6. Generally when customer reports a problem with a part, they refer to either the **Customer PO** number or **SO** number, using which they received those parts. In all the subsequent inquiry transaction they refer to these numbers. Hence, there is a need to capture both **PO number** and **SO number**. However, these fields are Optional.

-  **SO Number**:

    a. Click the **SO Number** lookup reference.

    The **Lookup For SO Number** window appears.

    b. Select the row and click **Select**.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the window.

    If you select the SO number first, then the corresponding account numbers and customer PO number are populated from the SO.

- **Customer PO Number**:

    a. Click the **Customer** **PO Number** lookup reference.

    The **Lookup For Customer PO Number** window appears.

    b. Select the row and click **Select**.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the window.

    If you select the customer PO number, which is associated with only one SO, then default the SO number and the corresponding account number.

    If you select the customer PO associated with multiple SO, then user should select the SO from the list. However, this is optional.

- **E-mail and Phone Number**:

    When the Customer is selected then the corresponding customer **Phone number**, **E-mail id** and **Customer** status are populated in the **Inquiry** page.

7. **Identify the problem:**

    The RMA migration script that moves the old **SYCSL** actions to the **Activities** area of **Customer Service Inquiry (CRMCSR)** page should use display value and not stored value for the **Assigned To**.

    - Click any one of the **Inquiry Types**. Select either **General**, **RMA**, or **Field Service** options to select the type of inquiry.

    - **General** – The inquiry concerns an issue not related to an RMA or Field Service.

    - **RMA** – The inquiry is about an RMA. After saving the inquiry, the **RMA** is active and click it to launch the **RMA** window where a new RMA can be created. See Add an RMA.
