In Made2Manage, you must change the status of a sales order that is in the **Started**, **On Hold**, or **Awaiting Approval** status to **Open** before you can work with it. A sales order typically remains in the **Open** status until all its items are shipped.

> **Note:** When a credit card immediate sale or pre-authorization transaction is processed for a sales order, the status of the sales order is automatically set to **Open**.

### To open sales order:

> **Note:** You cannot change the sales order status for an inactive customer. If attempted, the error message "Cannot Change Status. Customer is INACTIVE." is displayed.

3. In the **Reason** field, type any notes, if required.  
4. From the status dropdown at the top-right side of the window, select **Open**.
