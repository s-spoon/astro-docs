Here you can adjust the contract prices.

## To Adjust the Contract Prices
1. **Select** `Copy > Existing Customer`.  
   This displays the **Contract Adjustment (CONTADJ)** window. This is where you select the adjustment.  
   This window populates because when selected, it creates a contract from an existing contract.  
   Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Customer Contract Prices Add (CONTPR3)** window.  

2. **Set up Contract Adjustment:**  
   You can adjust the prices using either of the following methods:  
   - **Increase**  
   - **Decrease**  

   Adjust price by:  
   - **Percent**  
   - **Amount**  

   Enter the values and click **Create Contract**. This returns you to the **Customer Contracts (CONTPR)** page.  
   You can modify the fields in both the **Contract** and the **Parts** tab on this page.  
   If you do not want to adjust the prices, click **Cancel**.  

3. **Click Save** to keep the price schedule.  
   Click the **Parts** tab. The parts selected in the **Customer Contract Prices Add (CONTPR3)** page are listed here along with the adjusted price.
