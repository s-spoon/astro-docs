In Made2Manage, you must change the status of a sales order that is in the **Started**, **On Hold**, or **Awaiting Approval** status to **Open** before you can work with it. A sales order is usually in the **Open** status until all its items are shipped.

> [!Note]  When a credit card immediate sale or pre-authorization transaction is processed for a sales order, the status of the sales order is automatically set to **Open**.
