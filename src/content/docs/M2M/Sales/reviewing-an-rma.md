Items returned by the customer through a Return Receiver that are not assigned to any existing RMAs for that customer can be reviewed and assigned to an appropriate RMA. This allows you to manually add these items to an RMA or contact the customer to return the material.

### To review an RMA:

1. Open the **RMA Review (RMARVW)** page.  
2. Select an RMA number from the grid.  
   If no RMAs exist for this customer, an error message *No RMA Entries found for this Customer Number XXX.* appears:  
      
3. Click the **Lookup Reference** next to the **RMA No** field.  
   The **Lookup for RMA No** window appears, displaying all RMAs created for this customer.  
4. Select the required RMA No and click **Select** to populate the **RMA No** field.  
   Or click **Cancel** to exit without selecting.  
5. Click **Save.**  
   The selected item gets associated with the selected RMA number.  
   If the selected part number is already present in the RMA, a message *Part no XXXXX already present in the RMA #.* appears and the duplicate parts are not assigned to the RMA.

    
6. On the header, click **Mark as Reviewed.**  
   The selected items are removed from the *RMARVW* list and added to the selected RMA.
