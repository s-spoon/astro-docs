**To create credit memo from RMA**

1. Open the **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo (ARINV)** page.

    a. Select **Financial Management** > **Financial Transactions** > **Accounts Receivable** > **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo**.

    Or

    b. Search for **ARINV** or **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo**.

    The **Customer Invoices & Credit Memo (ARINV)** page appears.

2. On the toolbar, click **Copy**.

3. Select **Credit Memo** > **RMA**.

    The **Copying RMA** window lists all RMAs which have a **Ready for Credit** status.

    The credit can be processed without having a replacement SO for RMA with "Credit only" as instructions. But credit must still be issued once the item(s) are returned.

4. Select the required record and click **Select**.

    The **Copying Customer Invoices & Credit Memo** dialog box appears.

5. In the **Create Credit Memo for all quantities or for received quantities only** section, click:

    - **All**: To create a credit memo for the entire quantity.

    - **Received Quantity**: To create a credit for only the received quantity.

6. Click **Accept**.

7. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**.

    A message, *Do you wish to update notes for RMA being invoiced?* is displayed.

8. To update the notes:

    a. Click **Yes**.

    b. In the **Enter Notes** box, enter the notes.

    c. Click **Accept**.

    Once the Credit Memo is created and changed to **Unpaid** status, the status on the RMA will automatically change to **Closed**.
