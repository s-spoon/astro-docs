A casual bill of material roughly estimates the cost of materials needed to produce a part. For parts that do not already have standard bills of material, you can add casual bills of materials to your quotations and sales orders.

If a part has a detailed bill of material, you cannot create a casual bill of material.

**To add a casual bill of material**

1. Open the quotation or sales order.

2. Click the **Items** tab.

3. In the grid, select the row that contains the item.

4. Open the casual bill of material:

    a. Click the ellipsis under the **Action** column.

    b. Select **Grid Accessories** > **Grid Actions** > **Casual Bill Of Material**.

    The **Quote Casual Bill of Material** or **Sales Order Casual Bill of Material** page appears.

5. For each item to add:

    a. On the grid toolbar, click **New**.

    Or click **Copy** to add an item based on the highlighted item in the casual bill.

    b. In the **Description** box, enter the part's description.

    c. In the **Material Cost** box, enter the part's cost.

6. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**.
