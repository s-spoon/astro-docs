When you add items to a Sales Order, the item's shipping address key defaults to the **Shipping Address Key** shown on the **Billing/Shipping Address** tab in the **Sales Order** page. If required, you can change the shipping address on individual items so they can be shipped to a different address. For example, your customer may ask you to ship 6 out of 10 items to their main address, and ship the remaining 4 items to an alternate address.

If you later change the **Address Key** on the **Billing/Shipping Info** tab, the address key on the individual items will not be updated. If you need to update them so they match the header, you must do so manually.

The following instructions explain how to add 9999 ship-to addresses for individual sales order items. Refer to the topic Use alternate ship-to addresses without keeping them in Made2Manage for detailed instructions on using a 9999 ship-to address at the sales order header level.

**To change a ship-to address for a sales order item**

1. Open the item to change:

    - Open the sales order and click the **Items** tab.

    - Open the item to change.

2. Select **Use Misc Shipping Address** check box and then save the item.

3. By default, in the **Shipping Address** field, the ship-to address **9999** appears.

4. On the **Toolbar**, click **More Actions**.

5. Select **More Actions** > **Actions** > **Alternate Sales Order Address**.

    The **Alternate Sales Order Address** window appears.

6. Enter the alternate shipping address and then close the window to send to an alternate shipping address.
