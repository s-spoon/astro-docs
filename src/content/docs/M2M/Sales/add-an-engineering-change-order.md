An Engineering Change Order (ECO) outlines the proposed change to a part or a document and requests review and approval from the individuals who would be impacted or charged with implementing the change. Ideally, you should create an ECO for every change you want to make to a part or a document.

You can add an ECO template if you plan to make the same kind of engineering changes. An ECO template includes information on which you can base your changes. You can also include a standard list of recipients on the template's broadcast distribution list.
