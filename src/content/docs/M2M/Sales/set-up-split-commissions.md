Commissions can be split by associating salespeople and specific commission rates with individual items or releases on a sales order. When you add new items or new releases to a sales order or quotation, salespersons linked to the sales order's sold-to or ship-to address are added to the item and release(s) (if it is a multi-release item). Use the **Sales (CSSALE)** page to specify whether to use sold-to or ship-to addresses.

You can change the settings on this page at any time, and you can override these settings on individual sales orders.

### To set up split commissions:

1. Open the **Sales (CSSALE)** page.  
2. Click the **Miscellaneous** tab.  
3. In the **Multi-Split Commissions** section, select one of the following options:  
   - **Sold To**: Use the sold-to address when adding new items or new releases to a sales order or quotation.  
   - **Ship To**: Use the ship-to address when adding new items or new releases to a sales order or quotation.  
4. On the toolbar, click **Save**.
