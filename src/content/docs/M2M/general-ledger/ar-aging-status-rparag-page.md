Use the **AR Aging Status** report to generate Accounts Receivable aging, forecasting and status reports that help you monitor payments received from customers to:

- Alert you to late payments and

- Forecast cash

Enter an aging date prior to today's date, if desired. This will produce a report which ignores all activity after the date you input. The report excludes the following:

- Invoices with invoice dates after the date entered.

- Payments on invoices made after the date entered.

By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use **Advanced Filters** to customize or expand your filter criteria. For more information about **Advanced Filters**, click here.
