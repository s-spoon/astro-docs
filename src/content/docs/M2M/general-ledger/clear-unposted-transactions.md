You can remove unposted transactions to prevent them from being recorded in a general ledger account. This can be done in the accounts receivable, accounts payable, order costing, or payroll ledger. Unposted transactions occur due to irregular accounting events in a specific general ledger account. For example, this could happen when you delete a receiver or create an order costing transaction in a closed accounting period.
