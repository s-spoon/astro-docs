For the Indented Listing, Accounts are listed in Category order (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, CGS, Expenses, user Categories last). Each 'header' or 'parent' account number is followed by its 'children' or 'sub-accounts' in account number order, with each 'level' indented from the previous level.
