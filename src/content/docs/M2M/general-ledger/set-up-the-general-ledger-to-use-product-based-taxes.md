You can set up the general ledger to use a geographic-based or a product-based tax structure for applying taxes. The tax structure you use depends on your company's location.

- Explain

If your company uses product-based taxes, change the general ledger to use product-based taxes in Made2Manage. Once you set up the General Ledger to use product-based taxes, you should not change it.

**To set up the general ledger to use product-based taxes**
