Before you can work with multiple currencies, you must turn on the multiple currency feature.

Before you do this, you must add a general ledger account for foreign currency translation adjustments. See the related information. Set the account up as an asset (or contra-asset) or equity. Once you turn the multiple currency feature on, you cannot turn it off.

To turn on the multiple currency feature

1. Open the **General Ledger (CSGL)** page.

    a. Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **General Ledger**.

    Or

    b. Search for **CSGL** in the **Navigation box** and then select **General Ledger**

    The **General Ledger (CSGL)** page appears.

2. Click the **Default** **Country** Lookup Reference.

    The **Lookup For Default Country** window appears.

3. Select the row that contains the required country, and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row that contains the required country.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Lookup For Default Country** window.

    The currency associated with the country automatically displays in the **Default Currency** field.

    This is your company's functional currency, in other words the currency your company uses. Once you set the functional currency and transactions take place, you cannot change it.

5. In the **Default Account and Fiscal Year** section, select the **Multi-Currency** check box.

6. Click the **Frgn Currency Translation Adjustment Acct** Lookup Reference.

    The **Lookup For Frgn Currency Translation Adjustment Acct** window appears.
