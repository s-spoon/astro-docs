If you work with multiple currencies, you should create a separate bank account for each currency. Any bank account without a currency assignment uses the functional currency set up in the **General Ledger (CSGL)** page. See **Related Topics**.

Once you add an account, you cannot change its currency or remove the account.

**To add a bank account for each foreign currency**

1. Open the **Accounts Payable (CSAP)** page.

    a. Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **Accounts Payable**.

    Or

    b. Search for **CSAP** or **Accounts Payable** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Accounts Payable.**

    The **Accounts Payable (CSAP)** page appears.
