You can copy payroll transactions from your payroll system to the payroll subledger.

You can verify that the transactions copy successfully. Print a list of the transactions in your payroll system before copying them to the payroll sub-ledger. Then print a list of the payroll transactions to be posted to the general ledger (see the **Related Information**). Compare the two lists.
