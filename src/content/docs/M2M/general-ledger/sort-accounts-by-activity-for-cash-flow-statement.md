    a. Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **Cash Flows**.

    Or

    b. Search for **CSCF** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Cash Flows.**

    The **Cash Flows (CSCF)** page appears.

2. Sort accounts by financial activity:

    a. To view accounts for a general ledger category, in the **GL Categories** list, select the desired category.

    b. Select the accounts you want to include in the activity.

    c. Click the next button to the activity.

    d. Repeat these steps for each financial activity:
