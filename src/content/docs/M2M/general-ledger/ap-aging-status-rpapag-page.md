Use the **AP Aging Status** report to generate Accounts Payable aging, forecasting and status reports that help you ensure that payments are made to vendors at the appropriate time.

You can enter an aging date prior to today's date, if required. This produces a report that IGNORES all activity after the date you input. Specifically, the report excludes invoices with post dates after the date entered, and excludes payments posted after the date entered.

By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use Advanced Filters to cus- tomize or expand your filter criteria. For more information about Advanced Filters, click here.
