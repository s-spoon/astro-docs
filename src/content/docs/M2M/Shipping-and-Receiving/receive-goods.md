To update information about inventory, sales orders, and purchase orders, let Made2Manage know when you receive goods. Made2Manage helps you track the quantity and quality of goods, as well as lets you know which items to inspect. It can also give you a list of troublesome suppliers.

## To receive goods

1. Compare received items against purchased items to see if you received everything you bought.

2. Add a receiver.

3. Set information about the items you receive.

4. Inspect goods you receive:

   - Print a list of items awaiting inspection.

        You can also print a summary of goods you receive and check for suppliers that don't consistently perform to standards.
