You can view additional resources associated with an operation.

If you choose multiple resources to view and make changes, such as 10 or more, in the Additional Resources Gantt, it could take several minutes for the system to load the information and display the changes on the corresponding Gantt charts.

The **CCR Gantt** window is only available when Advanced Scheduling is active.

**To view additional resources for an operation**

1. Open the **Advanced Scheduling** menu and choose **CCR Gantt**.

2. Right-click the job order number in the left pane of the window and choose **Additional Resources Gantt**.

    The **Additional Resources Gantt chart** opens.

3. View the information.
