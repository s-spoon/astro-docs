You can run single script or define a group of scripts to run. Scripts in a group run in the order you add them to the group.

- [Run a single script from M2M Planning and Scheduling](run-a-single-script.md).

If you have several scripts to run on a schedule, group those scripts and schedule the group to run on that schedule. Grouping the scripts in this manner saves you time. You can run a group of scripts from two locations:

- [Run a group of scripts from M2M Planning and Scheduling](run-m2m-planning-and-scheduling-in-production-mode.md).

- Run a group of scripts from M2M ERP.
