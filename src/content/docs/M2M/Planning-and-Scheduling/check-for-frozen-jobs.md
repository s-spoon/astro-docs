Use the **Job Order Dispatch List** to view or print the production schedule sorted by job. You can filter the report to check for frozen jobs or released jobs and to view resource assignments.

This page performs the same functions as the **Work Center Dispatch List**, except the job orders are used instead of the work centers as the search criteria.

> [!Note] The **Job Order Dispatch List** page is only available when Advanced Scheduling is active.
