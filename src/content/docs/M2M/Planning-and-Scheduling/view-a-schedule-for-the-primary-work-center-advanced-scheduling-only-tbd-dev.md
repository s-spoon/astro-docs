The primary work center is the work center associated with the routing step (as opposed to an additional resources linked to that step as well.) You view the schedule for this work center as you would view the schedule for the primary or critical capacity constrained resource. For more information about the tasks you can perform on the Gantt chart, see Related Information.

The **CCR Gantt** window is only available when Advanced Scheduling is active.
