You can open the **Why Late** page for any late job from any of the Gantt charts, **Job Due Date Performance** page, **Supply/Demand By Part** page, or the **Interactive Planning by Sales Order** page. You can also open the **Why Late** page for any temporary job shown in **CTP Add** or **CTP Modify** where the scheduled job completion date is later than the requested sales order date.

**To open the Why Late window**

- In the left pane of any Gantt chart, right-click the late job order number, and select **Why Late**.

- Right-click the operation bar representing the late job and choose **Why Late**.

- In the windows other than the Gantt charts, select the row containing the job order information, and on the grid toolbar, click **Why Late**.
