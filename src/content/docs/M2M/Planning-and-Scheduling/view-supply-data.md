The Supply Data menu includes screens allows the user to be able to open a supply record directly from one window rather than navigating using the related links from screens such as material availability, supply demand by part and so on.

The user need not always open a supply transaction by knowing the reference part number, which is the case in material availability, supply demand by part screen and other such screens under the planning section.

The grids in these screens have auto-filter rows, this enables the user to directly enter the supply record number and identify the supply transaction with little effort. The user can then view the supply record details by clicking the related links or associated button in the grid toolbar.

The following pages are available under the **Supply Data** menu to view the record depending upon the type of order:

    - Job Order

    - PO Item

    - PPO

    - ISO

>[!Note] The **Supply Data** menu is used only to view the supply records, user can not modify any information in any screen under the **Supply Data** menu.
