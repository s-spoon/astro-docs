You can change a plan or schedule by changing an item on an existing sales order. If a customer decides to increase the quantity of an item or change the demand date, you can enter the change to see if you can deliver the customer's new request by the due date before you accept the change.

An item's demand appears in the **Demands** grid. Several supplies may support each demand. The supplies appear in the **Supplies** grid.

You can change only the quantity and requested date of the sales order release.
