Planning is the function to create and maintain a Supply plan, at all product structure levels, in response to demands. Scheduling is the function to sequence the jobs created by the Planning function. Scheduling the jobs means assigning start and end times for each job operation.

Planning and Scheduling are not simple functions. In fact, in the absence of powerful tools, creating good plans and schedules is a very difficult and complex task. Planning and Scheduling (formerly known as Synchronizer) is a set of integrated modules that allow for the planning and scheduling of production jobs that occur in a manufacturing environment. One of its main strengths is that the difficult and complex task of planning and scheduling take place largely behind-the-scenes, hidden from view, while providing an intuitive, easy to use, and intuitive way to implement a solution.

The Made2Manage Planning function is an optional module that includes:

- Automatic Infinite Planning function

- Interactive Planning tools

The Made2Manage Scheduling functionality is offered in two levels: **Basic** and **Advanced**.

- **Basic Scheduling** - An optional module integrated into Made2Manage that displays scheduling results in a graphical interface for viewing (and printing for distribution to the shop floor) along with drag-and-drop functionality to schedule jobs within work centers. (Basic Scheduling) includes the tools for manual and interactive scheduling, such as Gantt charts and a Whiteboard Scheduling tool. You must manually review Material constraints using the Supply/Demand and Material Availability windows in M2M. (Basic Scheduling)M2M Scheduling will not prevent a shortage of materials. You must review jobs having **Open** or **Released** status to verify material constraints before running a schedule.

- **Advanced Scheduling** - An optional Made2Manage module that automatically respects all the scheduling constraints, which include Precedence constraints, Resource constraints and Material constraints. (Advanced Scheduling) keeps your organization in synch by sharing real-time information in a common M2M ERP/SCM database. With Advanced Scheduling, you can prioritize, sequence, and schedule job operations in one step across work centers within capacity and material constraints. Using Automatic Scheduling and Capable to Promise (CTP) accurate sales order delivery can be made based on simulated schedule changes. Finite Planning, which considers Capacity and Material constraints and creates a plan which is both Capacity and Material feasible is supported only by Advanced Scheduling.

Planning and Scheduling consists of two components:

- The Planning and Scheduling Server

- The Planning and Scheduling Client(s)

Together they are referred to as the Planning and Scheduling Foundation. The Basic Scheduling, Advanced Scheduling, and Planning modules are built upon the Planning and Scheduling Foundation.
