M2M Planning and Scheduling generates the following types of Gantt charts when you try to schedule the jobs created by the planning function:

- Whiteboard Gantt (Basic Scheduling only)

- Primary Work Center, which shows the production schedule for the work center associated with the routing step (as opposed to any additional resources linked to that step as well.)

- Resource, which shows the production schedule for all work centers you choose to view. The two types of Resource Gantt charts are: Single and Multiple.

- Job, which shows a production schedule for a job order.

- Additional Resource, which displays any additional resources assigned to a job order.

The Gantt chart shows each work center's machines and assigned operations. If it is a CCR work center, the Gantt chart shows each of its machines separately with the assigned operations. For non-CCR work centers, all assigned operations appear as one group.

Each task has two parts: set-up and production, which are the bars in the Gantt chart's right pane. In this area of the window, you can drag and drop information — for example, you can change an operation's start and end dates. M2M Planning and Scheduling saves in M2M ERP any information you change in the right pane of the Gantt chart once you commit your What-If session..

The table in the Gantt chart's left pane displays information for each work center and/or machine. You can choose what information displays in this table. You can expand and collapse the displays of machine and/or work center tasks (true for Multi-Resource Gantt only).

You can change the view of the Gantt chart. The following views are available: Compressed View and Detailed View.

> [!Note] In the Multi-Resource Gantt, you can either view all gantts as compressed or detailed. You can not change the view for an individual gantt.

You can also display a load graph below the Gantt chart. For instructions, see the Related information box.

You can make several successive changes on the Gantt charts. M2M Planning and Scheduling logs these changes and considers them all when you save the schedule or update the schedule. You can make these changes on the Gantt charts:

- [Change job order information](change-job-order-information.md). 

- [Change a job order's operation information](change-a-job-orders-operation-information.md). 

- [Change the start and end date and time of an operation in the Gantt charts](change-the-start-and-end-date-and-time-of-an-operation-in-the-gantt-charts.md). 

- [Move an operation to another work center in the Gantt charts](move-an-operation-to-another-work-center-in-the-gantt-charts.md). 

- [Move a whole operation to an earlier or later start time and date](move-a-whole-operation-to-an-earlier-or-later-start-time-and-date.md). 

- [Choose the information that appears in the Gantt charts](customize-the-information-that-appears-in-the-gantt-charts.md). 

- [Change the capacity for simultaneous operations per shift in the workload and capacity graph below the Gantt charts](change-the-capacity-for-simultaneous-operations-per-shift-in-the-workload.md).   


- [Move an operation to a subcontract work center in the Gantt charts](move-an-operation-to-a-subcontract-work-center-in-the-gantt-charts.md).   


- [View work hours by shift in the Gantt charts](view-work-hours-by-shift-in-the-gantt-charts.md).   


- [View why the scheduled job completion date is later than the job due date](view-why-the-scheduled-job-completion-date-is-later-than-job-due-date.md). 

- [View detailed information for the job constraint](view-detailed-information-for-the-job-constraint.md). 

- [View why the calculated job due date in Capable-to-Promise is later than the requested ship dat](view-why-the-calculated-job-due-date-in-capable-to-promise-is-later-than-the-requested-ship-date.md). 

When you make changes, you may have to update (realign) the schedule.
