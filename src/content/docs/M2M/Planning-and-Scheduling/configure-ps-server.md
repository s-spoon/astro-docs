The **P&S Server Settings (PSSRV)** page contains the settings that configure the Planning and Scheduling Server.

Different sections within the **P&S Server Settings (PSSRV)** page contain settings that configure the server during different stages. The system, by default turns on or turns off the settings.

**To configure the P&S server**

1. Open the **P&S Server Settings (PSSRV)** page.

    - Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **P&S Server Settings**.

    Or

    - Search for **PSSRV** or **Server Settings** in the **Navigation box** and then select **P&S Server Settings**.

    The **P&S Server Settings (PSSRV)**  page appears.

2. Select or clear the check boxes that correspond to the required setting that's in the following sections. Some check boxes, after selection, may show further values within a list.

 |Section                                              | Description                                                                                                                                | Default Value  |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Startup**                                          | **Sync 2 ERP** Select to invoke the M2MReceiving Handler, and have the MSMQ messages from Planning and Scheduling update the M2M ERP database.                                                                                             | Cleared        |
|                                                      | **ERP 2 Sync** Select to have any relevant updates in M2M ERP update the Planning and Scheduling Server so that the Planning and Scheduling memory model matches the ERP database.                                                                                                             | Selected       |
|                                                      | **Use Auto Create Jobs** <li> Select to have the Planning function create jobs only for SO items that have **Create Jobs** selected. <li> Clear to have the Planning function not consider the **Create Jobs** flag, and create jobs for all SO items.                                                                                                                                              | Cleared        |
|                                                      | **Completed By Qty To Go** <li> Select to assume that all preceding operations (including sub-jobs) are also complete once a job operation completes. <li> Clear to remove a job operation from the schedule only when the job is reported as complete.                                                                                                                                               | Selected       |
|                                                      | **Set Completed Materials** A job material that belongs to a job operation that's already completed, but is not yet issued is marked with (C) on the **P&S** pages. If selected, these job materials consume On Hand inventory, if it exists, but are ignored otherwise. This logic accounts for a backflush situation in which the issue transactions are delayed until the job is completed. This situation can also occur when material is needed in a late operation but this is not specified in the job BOM. We recommend to fix this data issue. If you want these job materials to be considered as regular demand (until the BOM data is fixed), you can clear the check box. With the check box cleared, the job materials marked with (C) are considered as regular demands.                                                                                                                          | Cleared        |
| **Runtime**                                          | **Defer Completion Transactions** <li> Select to defer completion transactions and make them visible in the Planning and Scheduling system only when the user runs **Planning**, **Scheduling**, or **Re-scheduling**. This helps to coincide the processing of these transactions with the moving forward of the Schedule Start date and recreation of a new schedule. This is important in a CTP environment. <li> Clear to process the completion transactions immediately like any other ERP transactions.  <br> [!Note]   We strongly recommend not to change the default setting in environments where you use CTP.                                                                                                                 | Selected       |
|                                                      | **Defer All Transactions** Select to defer all ERP transactions and make them visible in the Planning and Scheduling system only when the user runs **Planning**, **Scheduling**, **Re-scheduling**, or **Realign Schedule**.                                                                                                              | Cleared        |
|                                                      | **Limit Sim Ops By Qty To Go** <li> Select so that for parts with a unit of measure of **Each** or **Piece**, the actual number of simultaneous operations will never be lesser than one. <li> If the operation quantity is lesser than the number of simultaneous operations of that job operation, the actual simultaneous operations will be **1**, as it is assumed that the quantity cannot be divided into a fraction that is processed on each machine. <li> If you clear the check box, the system removes this restriction.                                                                                                                            | Cleared        |
| **Plan**                                             | **Allow Negative On Hand** <li> Clear to have Planning regard the negative On Hand as a reporting error and assume that the actual inventory is zero. <li> Select to have Planning create supply to cover the negative On Hand (only for stock parts).                                                                                                                                           | Cleared        |
|                                                      | **Automatic Firming Upon Accept** <li> Select to have a supply order that is accepted on the Planning grid to automatically set as Firmed. <li> Clear to have a supply order that is accepted on the Planning grid to not automatically set as Firmed.                                                                                                                                    | Cleared        |
|                                                      | **Assembly Buffer For** Use the assembly buffer in one of the following three options: <li> **Stock**: Supports an assembly buffer on all non-purchased stock materials. <li> **CCR**: Supports the TOC philosophy. With this option, the assembly buffer protects the assemblies that follow the CCR operation. <li> **ALL**: Supports an assembly buffer on all non-purchased materials.                                                                                                                                                                     | Stock          |
|                                                      | **Built To Upper Tolerance** Select to have the Planning engine attempt to cover the requested SO release quantity inflated by the upper tolerance. However, the system considers the SO release as fulfilled, if the requested quantity was shipped.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Cleared        |
|                                                      | **Forecast Retention** <li> Select **Current Period** to fully retain the current forecasting period until it fully expires (the period end date becomes earlier than the Schedule Start date).  For e.g. if the **Forecast Period Calendar** is set to **Monthly** [on the **Planning** tab of the **Global Parameters (PSGLPARM)** page], the March forecast expires on April 1. <li> Select the number of days to retain the forecasting period for these number of days from the beginning of the period.  For e.g., if **Forecast Retention = 21**, the system retains the March forecast until March 21, and it expires on March 22. <li> Select **Remaining Current Period** to retain the forecasting period for the remaining number of days from the Schedule Start Date until the period end date.   For e.g., if the forecast period calendar is set to **Monthly** and the Schedule Start Date is March 21, then the system retains only March forecast quantities with discrete date after March 21. March forecast quantities with dates before March 21 are expired. | Current Period |
|                                                      | **Forecast Dep Demand** <li> Select the check box to assume that Forecast includes Sales Orders and Dependent Demands. <li> Clear the check box to assume that the Forecast was built against Sales Orders only.  The system calculates the Unconsumed Forecast accordingly where the included demands consume the Forecast for the same period.  When selected, the Dep Demand isn't included in the PAB(F) calculation.                                                                                                                                 | Selected       |
|                                                      | **Job Outstanding Qty By Operation** <li> Select to calculate the outstanding quantity of the job order by basing it on the Qty-to-Go of the last job operation (netted from the shipped or moved to inventory quantity).  <li> Clear to make the outstanding quantity of the job order as the job unshipped/unmoved quantity.  In the second option, Planning isn't sensitive to scrap (short completion) at the operation level. Planning in this case reacts to short completion only when the job is closed.                                                                                                                                              | Selected       |

The BOM levels can be selected from a default value of 20 to the range between 1- 99.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 20             |
| **Schedule**                                         | **Adjust Purchasing To Schedule** <li> Clear to drive Purchasing based on the plan as long as the Schedule is on-time or late compared to the plan. For a build-ahead schedule, the Schedule drives purchasing, regardless of the INI setting. <li> Select to set the need date of the purchased material to match the scheduled date of the fed operation.                                                                                               | Cleared        |

|                                                      | **Horizon Factor** The Scheduling Horizon defines the date range of jobs included in the schedule. Jobs are included in the schedule if their Due Dates are within the Scheduling Horizon. However, it's not known how far the schedule will span. The **Horizon Factor** defines how far the schedule can span. The default is six times the Scheduling Horizon.                                                                                                                                                                                       | 6              |
|                                                      | **Priority 1 Days** The number of days by which the need time of a priority 1 job is advanced. By offsetting the need time, the operations of this job and the jobs that feed it have a better chance to be scheduled on time. The larger the offset, the earlier the job tends to end because it's considered earlier in the schedule queue.
