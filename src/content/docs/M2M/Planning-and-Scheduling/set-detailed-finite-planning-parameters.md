You must set finite planning parameters for each company for which you use M2M Planning and Scheduling to plan production. Each company can have different parameter settings. Depending upon your environment's stability, you may have to adjust these parameters from time to time for the best schedules.

Use the **Planning** tab to enter detailed information about how Finite Planning should operate.

For M2M Planning and Scheduling to generate effective plans, set all parameters. If you use M2M Planning and Scheduling to schedule more than one company's production but want all companies to use the same parameters, set them for only the first company.

**To set detailed finite planning parameters**

1. Open the **Global Parameters (PSGLPARM)** page.

    - Select **Planning and Scheduling** > **P&S Production** > **Options** > **Global Parameters**.

    Or

    - Search for **PSGLPARM** or **Global Parameters** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Global Parameters**.
