Use the **Customize Zone Parameters (BMGZNPRM)** page to define the:

- Zone cumulative percentage for the Drums and Shipping buffers.

- The method used for calculating buffer penetration for job operations that have not yet arrived at the buffer.

Two options are supported for buffer penetration:

- **Actual Arrival**: Buffer Penetration is based on the actual arrival at the buffer as compared with the fixed buffer target schedule set at release time.

- **Schedule Arrival**: Buffer Penetration is based on the projected scheduled arrival as compared with the fixed buffer target schedule set at release time.

> [!Note] The Zones percentages and the Buffer Penetration calculation methods are stored centrally and are common to all users.
