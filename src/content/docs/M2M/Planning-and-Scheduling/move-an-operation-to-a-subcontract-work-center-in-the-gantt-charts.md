You can move a whole operation from a regular work center to a subcontract work center. All subcontract work centers begin with the SUB prefix. When you move an operation, everything associated with that operation in the detailed job routing moves too. You must update the schedule after you complete this task.

Before you move an operation between work centers, ensure you have both the originating and destination work center Gantt charts in view.

**To move an operation to a subcontract work center in the Gantt charts**

1. Open the **Multi Resource Gantt (PSMULTG)** page.

    - Select **Planning and Scheduling** > **P&S Production** > **Scheduling**  > **Multi Resource Gantt**.

    Or

    - Search for **PSSINGLG** or **Multi Resource Gantt** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Multi Resource Gantt**.

        The **Multi Resource Gantt (PSMULTG)**  page appears.

2. In the left pane of the window, select the work center and drag the operation's bar in the current work center to the subcontract work center.

3. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save**.
