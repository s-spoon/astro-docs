When you are satisfied with the rules and parameters you have set up for your company schedule, you are ready to schedule your existing jobs. When you generate or update a schedule, others in the system can view information but cannot make changes while the process takes place.

For open sales orders that do not have job orders, M2M Planning and Scheduling creates new job orders when it generates the plan. When you generate a schedule after you run the planning function, M2M Planning and Scheduling creates new jobs or changes quantities or due dates. You can also run the schedule to obtain a better result than the one you get from a previous schedule run as conditions may have changed in the interim.

> [!Note] The **Schedule** window is available only when Advanced Scheduling is active.
