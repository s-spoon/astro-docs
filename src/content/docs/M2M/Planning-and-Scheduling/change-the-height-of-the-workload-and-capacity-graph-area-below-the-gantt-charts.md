You can change the size of the workload and capacity graph to meet your viewing needs. You can do this on any of the Gantt charts. The left pane of the graph area below the Gantt chart displays the name of the work center. You can also view the number of simultaneous operations associated with the work center represented by the tick marks on the vertical axis. The actual graph in the right pane below the Gantt chart displays the work center capacity and the load currently scheduled. It is color coded to represent the portion of the load which is frozen and over capacity.

**To change the height of the workload and capacity graph area below the Gantt charts**

1. In the left pane of the window, click the work center name for the workload and capacity graph for which you want to change the viewing area.

2. Click and drag in the left pane of the graph area below the Gantt chart to change the height of the graph viewing area.

A **Modify numeric scale's width** popup box appears as you adjust the height, showing you the actual percentage to which you have changed the height.
