You can also move a whole operation to begin earlier or later than the current date and time. You can do this on any of the Gantt charts. You must update the schedule after you complete this task.

**To move a whole operation to an earlier or later start time and date**

1. Click and drag the bar in the right pane of the window to the desired date and time.

2. A **Move Layer** popup box appears as you move the bar, showing you the actual date and time to which you move the operation.
