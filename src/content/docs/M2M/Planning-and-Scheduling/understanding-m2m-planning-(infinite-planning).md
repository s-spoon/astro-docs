M2M Planning and Scheduling includes an infinite planning function, which provides a complete replacement of MRP for manufactured parts.

Planning is the process of creating job orders (due dates and quantities) at all levels of the BOM in response to demand. It can be in response to forecast, to sales orders, to a safety stock requirement, or to a dependent demand coming from a higher-level job.

Infinite planning means planning without considering available capacity. Infinite planning can suggest that you make or buy something in the past. M2M Basic Planning automates infinite planning. Open jobs appear based on demand and the parameters you set. You can manipulate parameters and other options to get the schedule exactly where you want it.

M2M Advanced Planning offers true finite planning. In finite planning, jobs are created within capacity and material constraints, which means the job due dates and quantities are roughly feasible before they are ever scheduled. So when the jobs are scheduled, they are more likely to be completed on time.
