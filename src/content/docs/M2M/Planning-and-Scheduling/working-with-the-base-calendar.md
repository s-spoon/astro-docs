The base calendar (only available in Advanced Scheduling) defines production and work center calendars and shift arrangements for each day of the normal or standard work week. It is not date specific, that is, it does not describe the differences between one week and another. The calendar supports up to three shifts and can accommodate a maximum of three breaks within each shift. (Basic Scheduling) uses the production calendar defined in the M2M ERP **Production Calendar (CALNDR)** page.

You should create and modify the production and work center calendars before running the scheduling option. The system uses this information to create the working schedule. You can modify the calendars at any time.

You can view and modify the base calendar at different resource levels:

- **Company Base Calendar** – This is the most basic level, and is required. It defines the standard work week calendar for all company facilities and associated work centers. It defines shift data for each day of the week, and supports up to three shifts each day, and allows a maximum of three breaks per shift.

- **Facility Base Calendar** – This level overrides the company level base calendar. It defines the differences in the base calendar for a specific facility and its associated work centers.

- **Work Center Base Calendar** – This level overrides the company and/or facility base calendar. It defines the differences in the base calendar for a specific work center in a specific facility.

Once you create base calendars at the company, facility, and/or work center levels, you can use the Calendar Variation window to define calendar or shift changes for a specific date or range of dates. You can apply the following variations to a single shift (with the exception of a non-work day):

- Down time

- Overtime

- Shutdown

- Capacity change

- Non-work day

- Miscellaneous

- Operative
