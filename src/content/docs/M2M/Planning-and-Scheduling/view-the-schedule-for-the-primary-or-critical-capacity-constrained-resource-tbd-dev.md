When you tell M2M Advanced Planning and Scheduling to schedule the jobs the planning function creates, M2M Advanced Planning and Scheduling produces Gantt charts on which you can see your job orders and operations associated with the primary or critical capacity constrained resource (CCR). 

The **CCR Gantt** window is only available when Advanced Scheduling is active.

**To view the schedule for the primary or critical capacity constrained resource**

1. From within M2M Planning and Scheduling:

    -   Open the **Advanced Scheduling** menu

    -   Choose **CCR Gantt**

2. View the information.
