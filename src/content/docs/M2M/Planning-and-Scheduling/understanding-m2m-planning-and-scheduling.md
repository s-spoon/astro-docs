M2M Planning and Scheduling is the foundation for M2M Planning, M2M Scheduling, and M2M Advanced Scheduling. It performs the following functions:

- Provides the platform on which M2M Planning, M2M Scheduling, and M2M Advanced Scheduling exist.

- Launches M2M Planning, M2M Scheduling, and M2M Advanced Scheduling.

- Shares and synchronizes data between M2M ERP and the Planning and Scheduling Foundation, regardless of whether you are using Basic or Advanced Planning and Scheduling.

In Help, M2M Planning and Scheduling usually refers to the any combination of M2M Planning, M2M Scheduling, and M2M Advanced Scheduling.

Your company's specific configuration may include M2M Planning, M2M Scheduling, and M2M Advanced Scheduling, or a combination of any of them. Certain windows and options are only available for M2M Planning, M2M Scheduling, and M2M Advanced Scheduling.

> [!Note] For specific tasks, the Help files indicate whether or not the window or option is available when only one program is active.

M2M Advanced Scheduling uses general principles of the Theory of Constraints to schedule production. It helps to sequence and load job operations in all work centers in order to minimize job lateness and achieve the plan.

M2M Planning and Scheduling foundation synchronizes with M2M ERP. The information you enter in M2M ERP flows into M2M Planning and Scheduling to keep your schedules current. If you are working in the What-If mode, the information from Planning and Scheduling is updated in M2M ERP when you commit your changes. If you are working in the Production mode, the information from Planning and Scheduling is updated in M2M ERP immediately.
