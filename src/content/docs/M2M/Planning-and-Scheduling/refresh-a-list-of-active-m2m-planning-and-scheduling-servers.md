The M2M Planning and Scheduling console does not automatically update the list of M2M Planning and Scheduling servers when you manually shut down or launch a new server. You can update the list of active M2M Planning and Scheduling servers at any time. You can also view the number of M2M Planning and Scheduling messages left in the messaging queue to be processed by M2M ERP. If you make a big schedule change, it may take M2M ERP longer to process the messages and reflect the changes.

**To refresh a list of active M2M Planning and Scheduling servers**

1. Go to **Start** > **Programs** > **M2M Planning and Scheduling Client** > **Console**.

2. Click the **Refresh** button.

3. In the **Running Servers** area, view the updated list of active servers and a tally of outstanding messages from each server waiting processing into M2M ERP.
