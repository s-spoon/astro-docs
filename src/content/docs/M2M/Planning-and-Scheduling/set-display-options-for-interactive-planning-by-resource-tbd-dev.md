You can choose which supply and demand data or calculations to display in the five columns of the main Interactive Planning by Resource window. Also use this window to set how to project supply availability.

**To set display options for interactive planning by resource**

1. On the Toolbar, click **More Actions**.

2. Go to **More Actions** > **Actions** > **Display Options**.

    The **Display Options** window appears.

3. Choose which information appears in each column of the **Interactive Planning by Resource** window.

    -   For each column, click the arrow at the end of the **Supply/Demand Column** box and choose the information to use.

    -   Click the arrow at the end of the **PAB for Filter Condition** box and choose the projected available balance (PAB) by demand type.

    -   What do these values mean?

3. In the **Supply/Demand Calculation Based on** area, choose how to project supply availability. If you only use Finite Planning, use the **Job Due Date** to determine when supply quantities become available. If you use both Finite Planning and Demand Forecasting, use the **Best Known Date** to determine when supply quantities become available. This option uses the job due date (when one is available). Otherwise, it uses the scheduled finish date.

4. Click the **OK** button to save your changes and close the window.
