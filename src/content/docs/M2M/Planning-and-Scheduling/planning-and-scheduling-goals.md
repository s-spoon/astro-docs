The M2M Planning goal can be set to either maximize on-time delivery or maximize tactical profit.

The M2M Scheduling goal is to minimize job lateness while fulfilling the plan.

Optimization technology in M2M Planning helps to leverage many demands for many parts against capacity and material constraints in order to find the best possible set of jobs based on due dates and order quantities. Similar optimization technology in M2M Scheduling helps find the best sequence of jobs across all work centers to meet the job due dates and to maximize on-time delivery.

> [!Note] Work centers can be sequenced at the work center or machine level. For more information, search Planning and Scheduling Help's Index for, "work centers:scheduling by characteristic."

Jobs with a status of On-Hold are treated as existing inventory by M2M Planning. Jobs in On-Hold status are:

- Visible in all Supply/Demand windows

- Included in projected available balances calculations

- Not modified or deleted by any planning function

- Not subject to scheduling

M2M Scheduling offers three ways to minimize job lateness:

- Minimize the total number of late jobs.

- Minimize total late hours. You might have more late jobs overall, but each of them would be less late on average.

- Minimize the worst-case late job. You might have more late jobs overall, but the latest job will be as little late as possible.

In addition to minimizing lateness, M2M Scheduling can push to have the finished product done just-in-time so that you do not have to store it inventory, yet not ship the product too early or late.
