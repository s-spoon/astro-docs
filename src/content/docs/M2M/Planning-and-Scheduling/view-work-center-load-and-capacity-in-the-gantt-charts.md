You can view a graph of workload and capacity for a specific work center or operation from the Gantt chart. This is helpful if you want to move an operation to another work center and need to know what work center can handle an extra operation.

The **CCR Gantt** window is only available when Advanced Scheduling is active.

**To view work center load and capacity in the Gantt charts**

1. Open the **Multi Resource Gantt (PSMULTG)** page.

    - Select **Planning and Scheduling** > **P&S Production** > **Scheduling**  > **Multi Resource Gantt**.

    Or

    - Search for **PSSINGLG** or **Multi Resource Gantt** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Multi Resource Gantt**.

    The **Multi Resource Gantt (PSMULTG)**  page appears.

2. Click the work center in the left pane of the window for which you want to view workload and capacity information.
