If you use the **Advanced Planning** option for Planning and Scheduling, you can specify alternate resources for any operation on a routing within ERP. Advanced Planning may use the alternate resource to produce the part if the original work center is overloaded. You can specify more than one alternate resource per operation. You can also specify alternate resources for all instances of a part, or for only one instance.

You can view a part's alternate routing information, including route details, through the **Interactive Planning by Part** page.

**To view a part's alternate routing information**

1. If Advanced Planning is active, open the **Advanced Planning** menu and choose **Interactive Planning by Part - Finite**.

2. Find the part:

Only part's set up with alternate resources in M2M ERP have alternate routings. For more information on working with alternate resources, Search M2M ERP Help's Index for, "alternate resources."

    -   Click the **Find Record** button.
    -   Type the part number.

    Or type the first characters of the part in the **Value** box and click the **Find Next** button until the correct part appears.

    -   Right-click on the part and choose **Max Add**.

    The **Max Add by Route** window appears. Routing alternatives are sorted by Max Add value.

3. To view details about a route, right-click the row of the route you want to view details and choose **Route Details** window.
