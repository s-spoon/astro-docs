While M2M Planning and Scheduling is in What-If mode, none of your modifications and changes affect M2M ERP or your shop floor. You use What-If mode to create and fine-tune your schedule before you commit it in production mode. Running in What-If mode prevents M2M Planning and Scheduling from updating M2M ERP until you commit the schedule, but still allows you to get real-time updates from M2M ERP.

While you are in What-If mode, you typically:

- Run a series of schedules and review the results

- Analyze and modify the data

- Rerun the schedule

You repeat these steps until you feel comfortable with the schedule results. You can then change over to production mode to apply the schedule to the shop floor.

More than one user can work in What-If mode for the same company while other users see changes you make in the same session.
