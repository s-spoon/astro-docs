Update the schedule when you receive information about shop floor progress or when you need to manually change the sequence of activities in a work center. Whenever you make such a change, the **Reschedule** button becomes active on the Gantt chart.

Show me some examples of when to update the schedule.

**To update the schedule**

1. Start the What-If session.

2. Open the **Reschedule (PSRESCHD)** page.

    a. Select **Scheduling**> **Reschedule** .

    Or

    b. Search for **PSRESCHD** or **Reschedule**  in the **Navigation box** and then select **Reschedule** .

    The **Reschedule (PSRESCHD)**  page appears.

2. From the **Start Time Alignment** list, select one of the following options to select the start time of the schedule:
