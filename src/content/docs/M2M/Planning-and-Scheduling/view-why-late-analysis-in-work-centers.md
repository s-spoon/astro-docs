| Grid                          | Description                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Work Centers Causing Lateness | Work centers that contribute for a lateness of at least one job are listed in this pane. By default the work centers are sorted in descending sequence on Days Late. The Days Late is the sum of all the late job operations of a work center. Upon selection of a work center, the list of late job operations is refreshed in the **Late Job Operations** grid below. |
| Late Job Operations           | The job operations that are late due to the capacity constraint of the above work center are listed in this pane. By default the job operations are sorted by schedule start time of the operation (Operation Start).  The Due Date and Schedule Date are properties of the job. The Days Late is the lateness due to the above work center constraint.                 |
| Peg Demands                   | The Job selected on the bottom left pane in the **Late Job Operations** grid is at the root of the Pegging tree. The affected top level demands are visible on the leaves of the Pegging tree. The late top level demands are highlighted in red.  As needed the Resource Gantt can be opened via the Related menu.                                                     |
