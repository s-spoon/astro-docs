The Whiteboard Gantt allows you to view all scheduled and unscheduled jobs for a specific work center. It provides a clear visual representation of job schedules, enabling manual adjustments based on capacity and deadlines.

**Key Actions:**

- **View Scheduled and Unscheduled Jobs**: Use the Gantt chart to identify jobs and their current schedules.
- **Schedule Jobs Manually**: Schedule jobs using ASAP (As Soon As Possible) or JIT (Just In Time) methods. Drag and drop job bars to adjust schedules.
- **Address Lateness**: If a job is late, drag it ahead to an earlier time slot, ensuring capacity is available.
- **Commit Changes to ERP**: Once adjustments are complete, commit the updated plan and schedule to the ERP system.

> **Note**: Ensure you understand the work center's schedule and capacity before making changes.

## Whiteboard Sorting

The Whiteboard Sorting feature allows you to adjust the order of tasks directly on the Gantt chart. This feature helps optimize task sequencing based on priorities or available resources.

Users can drag and drop task bars to rearrange their order as needed.
