    | Late Job Operation Due to Manual Sequence | All the job operations delayed due to manual sequence changes are listed on the left pane.   The Constraint column contains the job operation that is enforced to run ahead of the delayed job operation and thus push its schedule out and cause it to be late.   The Days Late column is the lateness contributed by the manual sequence change. By default these job operations are sorted in descending sequence on Total Late Hours. Upon selection of a job operation on the left side, the Peg Demands on the right side is refreshed accordingly. More details on the job schedule can be found on the Operations tab, which is visible, and automatically selected, on the Peg Demand side. |
    | Peg Demands                               |  The job listed on the left pane is at the root of the Pegging tree.  The job operation selected on the left pane is visible and automatically selected on the Job Operations tab on the right side. The affected top level demands are visible at the leaves of the Pegging tree. The late top level demands are highlighted in red. At least one of the top level demands should be late.                                                                                                  |
