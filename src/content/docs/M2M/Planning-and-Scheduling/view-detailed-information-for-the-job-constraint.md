Once Why Late has identified a job constraint, you can view information about that constraint in the schedule. Depending on the type of constraint, you can open more than one window.

    - If the reason is Work Center, you can open the related Resource Gantt chart.

    - If the reason is Inventory, you can open the **Supply/Demand By Part** page or the related **Materials** page.

    - If the reason is Purchase Order, you can open the related **Materials** page.

    - If the reason is due to Schedule Start, Frozen, Completion Time or Previous Operation, you can open the **Operation** page, **Job** page, or **Job Order Gantt**.

**To view detailed information for the job constraint**

1. Open the **Why Late** page.


2. Right-click the **Type** column and choose the window you want to view.
