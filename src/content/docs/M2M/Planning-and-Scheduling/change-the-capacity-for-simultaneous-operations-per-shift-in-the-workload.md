You can increase or decrease the capacity for a work center by changing the number of simultaneous operations in one or more shifts. You can do this on any of the Gantt charts. The Calendar Variation reflects the changes immediately.

**To change the capacity for simultaneous operations per shift in the workload and capacity graph below the Gantt charts**

1. In the left pane of the window, click the work center name for the workload and capacity graph for which you want to change the capacity.

2. Click and drag the top part of the graph bar below the Gantt chart to increase or decrease the capacity.

The outline of the graph bar increases or decreases in size in increments equal to one simultaneous operation.
