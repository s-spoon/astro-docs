The history of the actual queues in front of the buffered work centers is recorded automatically based on the actual queue size at the time of job completion.

You can set a Period scope and Work Center scope for the report (see the Buffer Penetration section for detailed information on setting scope data).

**Charts can be generated for**:

- **Buffer Zones Frequency:** Same as History Buffer Penetration report, except for the difference in the zone definition

- **Zones by Period:** Same as History Buffer Penetration report, except for the difference in the zone definition

- **Actual Buffer by Period:** Shows the average queue size at each period compared with the planned buffer.
