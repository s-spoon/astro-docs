You can move an operation from one work center to another on any of the Gantt charts. When you move an operation in this way, everything associated with that operation in the detailed job routing moves too. You must update the schedule after you complete this task.

**To move an operation to another work center in the Gantt charts**

1. In the right pane of the window, hold the **Shift** key down and drag the operation's bar to a new work center.

Ensure you have both the current work center and the new work center to which you want to move an operation displayed.

2. Click **Save**.
