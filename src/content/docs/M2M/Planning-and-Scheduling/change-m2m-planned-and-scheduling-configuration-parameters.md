draft: false
type: Article

---

In addition to global parameters and schedule options, there are several other parameters that can affect M2M Planning and Scheduling's operations. Make these configuration changes in your **SynchServ.ini** file. When you make configuration changes, you must restart the M2M Planning and Scheduling server for the changes to take effect.

Since many of the entries are self-explanatory, they are not all described below. The following information shows the default value where applicable.

Click on the following links to jump to a description of a particular ini setting.
