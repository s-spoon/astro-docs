    For more details, refer to the [ConfigSettings.xml](#configsettingsxml) section.

3.  Open the EAM_Config.xml file located in C:\\LiteIntegration using a text editor, and update the EAM_Config.xml file.
   
    >[!NOTE]
    >You require administrator rights to update the EAM_Config.xml file.

    1.  Change EAM_Config.xml for the integration process configurations.
    2.  Match {EAM-Company} to {M2M-CompanyDB}, and {EAM-plant} to {M2M-facility}.
    3.  Add Vendor Types, Purchase Category under \<DataSourceConfig>.

        ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/5c0e8507e16b681c362d1af7ed72dfcc.png)

    4.  Update M2M API configuration and EAM API configuration information under the \<Main> loop.

        ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/26e4ffab93ef9921b57db02dd16f8d81.png)

    5.  Update AIP configs with M2M and EAM tenant information, which can be obtained from the DevOps or Dev team.

        ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/eaa1183738a857c863860faa508e6865.png)

For more details, refer to the [EAM_config.xml](#eam_configxml) section.

4.  Configure New Company. To add a new company, create a new tenant with a unique name (Example: DB002). The \<tenant> body must be copied and pasted below \</Tenant>.

    ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/b9ca25f9b8ff597ff04ad42be7b71695.png)

5.  If EMF or MariaDB already exists in the environment (if the EAM integration solution has been executed previously), perform the following:
    1.  Remove the Smart Hub Repository database.
    2.  Uninstall MariaDB.
    3.  Stop the Smart Hub server from services and uninstall the Smart Hub application.
6.  Run Setup.bat:
    1.  Open the command prompt in Administrator mode and navigate to the C:\\LiteIntegration folder.
    2.  Run the Setup.bat file; it should perform the following:
        -   Install MariaDB 10.6.10.
        -   Install Smart Hub application (v733).
        -   Create a repository with the name specified in ConfigSettings.xml.
        -   Install Smart Hub license.
        -   Import the Master package into the repository and run the Installer process.
        -   Create processes and services based on the tenant details specified in EAM\_ config.xml.

            ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/58401315b45f0d6acf926fb80bf44a01.png)

            >[!TIP]
            >In the provided example, configuration is done for two tenants. For the 1st tenant, the plant code is CST, and the facility is DEFAULT. For the 2nd tenant, the plant code is BM2, and the facility is EAMTEST. In the above example, two sets of processes will be created: one for Plant CST and the other for BM2.

        -   Run the Configure Database process, setting up all configurations according to the details specified in EAM_config.xml.
        -   After successful completion, sensitive information will be masked, and file names will be changed (e.g., ConfigSettings.xml converts to ConfigSettings_ masked.xml, EAM_config.xml converts to EAM_config_masked.xml).
7.  To set up another company, change the file names:
    1.  Rename the EAM_config_masked.xml file to EAM_config.xml and provide values for specific fields instead of masked text:
        1.  /Settings/Main/M2MConfigs/password
        2.  /Settings/Main/EAMConfigs/clientSecret
    2.  Rename the ConfigSettings_masked.xml file to ConfigSettings.xml and provide values for specific fields instead of masked text:

        1. /Settings/DatabaseSettings/adminPassword

    3.  Add new company configurations in the EAM_config.xml file.
    4.  Run the Installer process to create tenant-specific processes and services.
    5.  After the successful installation of the added company, sensitive information will be masked, and file names will be changed (e.g., ConfigSettings.xml converts to ConfigSettings_masked.xml, EAM_config.xml converts to EAM_config_masked.xml).

## For Existing Environment Setup with NU Already Installed (Manual Import)

Follow the steps below to set up an existing environment with NU already installed:

1.  Download and copy the latest file to C:\\LiteIntegration.
2.  Change the file name of EAM_config_masked.xml to EAM_config.xml.
3.  Update the settings in the EAM_config.xml file.
4.  Open Smart Hub and log in to repositories.
5.  Right-click on the Root Folder, select the Import option from the context menu, and choose the NU EAM xemf file from the location in the first step. Complete the import. This action should create an EAMIntegration folder and processes.
6.  Modify the following fields in the JDBC connection settings of the repository after exporting:
    -   Username: Set up while creating the repository.
    -   Password: Created for the above username to log in to the DB.
    -   Database Name: The repository name will be used.
7.  Expand the EAMIntegration folder, go to the ConfigureDatabase process, then right-click and select the Run Now option from the context menu. This action should initiate the configuration of the EAM integration.
8.  Exit Smart Hub.

## Field Validations

Ensure synchronization of validation codes for the following fields between M2M and EAM:

-   The Vendor Type in M2M should match the Supplier Type in EAM.
-   The Currency Code in M2M should match the Currency Code in EAM.
-   The Shipping Method in M2M should match the Freight Code in EAM.
-   The Vendor Payment Terms Code in M2M should match the Supplier Terms Code in EAM.
-   The Planner Code in M2M should match the Buyer Code in EAM.

## Error Notification

In the event of any errors during integration, notifications will be sent to recipients subscribed to the M2MIntegrationAdmin job function in EAM.

## Known Issues

1.  If any updates are made to a Purchase Order (PO) in M2M that has already been synced to EAM, a change order will be created in EAM. Note that the update is not specific to changes in order quantity.
2.  Receipts for Blanket POs cannot be created in EAM. An error notification will be sent, indicating that the PO does not exist if an attempt is made to create it.
3.  Once contact details of a vendor in M2M are synced to EAM, modifying the contact's first name or last name will add a new contact to the vendor in EAM.
4.  The supplier address value will not be pulled into the PO record in EAM which is created from M2M.

## Points to Note

1.  If a vendor is deleted in M2M, manual deletion is required in EAM.
2.  Active vendors in M2M will be transferred to EAM. If a vendor is made inactive in M2M and is synced in EAM, the integration will update the vendor's status as inactive in EAM.
3.  While creating a Requisition to PO, if an item is standard, the revision and unit cost will be updated from the Item Master in M2M. If nonstandard, it will be considered as NS, and the unit cost will be updated as in EAM.
4.  Avoid using special characters (', ", /, +) when creating records in M2M.
5.  Field length limitations for the following fields when creating items in the Requisition of EAM:
    -   Item – max length (25)
    -   Qty Received – 15 (including decimal)
    -   Qty Returned – 15 (including decimal)
    -   Unit cost – 17 (including decimal)
    -   Qty Ordered – 15 (including decimal)

    If data provided exceeds the specified length, the PO will not be created in M2M and will send an error notification.

6.  When importing suppliers to EAM, the Ship Method field from M2M is linked to the Freight field in EAM. If the Ship Method information is not available in M2M, the vendor can still be synchronized, but the Freight field in EAM must be filled in manually, as it is a required field.
7.  While creating a Requisition in EAM, Purchasing interface should be enabled in Module availability.
8.  Please note the following while making any changes for PO or creating a Receiver in M2M:
    1.  Text length in Location should not exceed 5; otherwise, it will be truncated to 5 in EAM.
    2.  Text length in Unit cost should not exceed 10 (including decimal); otherwise, it won't import to EAM and throws an error notification.
    3.  Text length for Quantity Ordered/Received (including decimal) should not exceed 10; otherwise, it won't import to EAM and throws an error notification.
9.  Steps to set up Over Receipts in EAM:
    1.  Go to Setup in EAM Navigation bar.
    2.  Select Setup Options in the Drop-down.
    3.  Go to Inventory Options and select General.
    4.  Click on DETAILS in the right-side panel.
    5.  Edit and select the required option under Over Receipts.
    6.  Select an option:
        -   **Do Not Allow Quantity on Hand to Fall Below Zero** – Throws an error if over- received.
        -   **Allow Quantity on Hand to Fall Below Zero; No Warning** – Allows over- receiving.
        -   **Allow Quantity on Hand to Fall Below Zero; Provide a Warning** – Provides a warning if over-received.

## Test Scenario - Supplier Integration

1.  Create a vendor in M2M, filling in all the necessary fields. Change the vendor status to Approved, and configure the vendor type to match your setup configuration for synchronization. Map the fields mentioned in the Field Mapping to EAM.
2.  The Supplier Integration process will run according to the scheduled time specified in the configuration. During execution, the integration will pick up this vendor and update it in EAM.
3.  The supplier will be created in EAM as depicted in the image below:

## Test Scenario - Requisition to PO

1.  Create a requisition in EAM with the required items and approve it.
2.  Execute the Requisition Integration process based on the scheduled time specified in the configuration. During execution, the system will retrieve the created requisitions and generate purchase orders in the M2M system. Subsequently, an acknowledgment is sent to EAM to confirm the successful creation of the purchase order. Any errors occurring during this process will be communicated within the acknowledgment.
3.  Purchase orders will be created per vendor. For example, if a requisition has three line items, where the first two have one vendor and the third another vendor, then two purchase orders will be created in M2M: the first with two items and the second with one.
4.  Purchase orders will be created in M2M as depicted in the image below:

## Test Scenario - Purchase Order Integration

1.  Make the necessary changes for the purchase order created in M2M and update the status to Open.
2.  Execute the Purchase Integration process based on the scheduled time specified in the configuration. During execution, the system will retrieve the purchase order and create it in EAM. If any changes are made to the purchase order after syncing to EAM, a change order will be generated in EAM.
3.  Purchase orders will be created in EAM as shown in the image below:

## Test Scenario - Receipt Integration

1.  Create a receiver for the PO created from the EAM requisition in M2M and change the status to Received.
2.  Execute the Receipt Integration process based on the scheduled time specified in the configuration. During execution, the system will retrieve the receipts from M2M and create them in EAM.
3.  Purchase receipts will be created as shown in the image below:
