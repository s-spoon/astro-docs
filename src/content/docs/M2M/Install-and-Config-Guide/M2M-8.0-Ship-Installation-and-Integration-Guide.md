## Installation Instructions for Ship Integration

This section provides the steps for installing the Ship integration within Smart Hub.

>[!NOTE]
>The installation process will be managed by the Aptean Support team.

To set up Smart Hub for the integration, perform the following:

1.  Download and extract the installation package.
    1.  Download the certified version of the package zip file (NU_Ship_Made2Manage_8.0_ 2024xxxx.x.zip) from the [M2M-Ship Integration SharePoint](https://apteanonline.sharepoint.com/teams/NoUpgradeIntegration/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2FNoUpgradeIntegration%2FShared%20Documents%2FIntegration%20with%20M2M%2FInstall%20Packages%2FNU%20Ship%2FM2M%208%2E0%20v1%2E1%2E0%2FNU%5FShip%5FMade2Manage%5FM2M8%2E0%5F20240201%2E1%2Ezip&parent=%2Fteams%2FNoUpgradeIntegration%2FShared%20Documents%2FIntegration%20with%20M2M%2FInstall%20Packages%2FNU%20Ship%2FM2M%208%2E0%20v1%2E1%2E0&p=true&ct=1713944741648&or=Teams%2DHL&ga=1) location.
    2.  Unzip the file and copy all the contents to C:LiteIntegration as shown below:

        ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/80696325f32735e76025c59c2f948539.png)

2.  Open the ConfigSettings.xml file located in C:LiteIntegration using a text editor, and update it for Smart Hub installation and configurations. This file is used to set the parameters required to install Smart Hub.

    >[!NOTE]
    >You require administrator rights to update the ConfigSettings.xml file.

    -   Update the installation path and Repository name. Update <EMFInstallationPath> with the value where EMF is installed in the VM.

        ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/2cb41a8e16af09d64dab368ad03bc64a.png)

        For more details, refer to the [ConfigSettings.xml](#configsettingsxml) section.

3.  Open the ConfigShip.xml file located in C:LiteIntegration using a text editor, and update the ConfigShip.xml file.
    1.  Change ConfigShip.xml for the integration process configurations.
    2.  Update M2M API configuration and Ship API configuration information under the <Main> loop.

        ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/82660efb2b0aecc7fd75c5a99ebd04ca.png)

    3. Update AIP configs with M2M and Ship tenant information, which can be obtained from the DevOps or Dev team.
            
        For more details, refer to the [ConfigShip.xml](#configshipxml) section.

4.  Configure New Company. To add a new company, create a new tenant with a unique name (Example: DB002). The <tenant> body must be copied and pasted below </Tenant>.
5.  If EMF or MariaDB already exists in the environment (if the Ship integration solution has been executed previously), perform the following:
    1.  Remove the Smart Hub Repository database.
    2.  Uninstall MariaDB.
    3.  Stop the Smart Hub server from services and uninstall the Smart Hub application.
6.  Run Setup.bat:
    1.  Open the command prompt in Administrator mode and navigate to the C:LiteIntegration folder.
    2.  Run the Setup.bat file; it should perform the following:
        -   Install MariaDB 10.6.10.
        -   Install Smart Hub application (v733).
        -   Create a repository with the name specified in ConfigSettings.xml.
        -   Install Smart Hub license.
        -   Import the Master package into the repository and run the Installer process.
        -   Create processes and services based on the tenant details specified in ConfigShip.xml.
        -   Run the ConfigureDatabase process, setting up all configurations according to the details specified in ConfigShip.xml.
        -   After successful completion, sensitive information will be masked, and file names will be changed (e.g., ConfigSettings.xml converts to ConfigSettings_ masked.xml, ConfigShip.xml converts to ConfigShip_masked.xml).
7.  To set up another company, change the file names:
    1.  Rename the ConfigShip_masked.xml file to ConfigShip.xml and provide values for specific fields instead of masked text:
        1.  /Settings/Main/M2MConfigs/password
        2.  /Settings/Main/ShipConfigs/clientSecret
    2.  Rename the ConfigSettings_masked.xml file to ConfigSettings.xml and provide values for specific fields instead of masked text:
        i. /Settings/DatabaseSettings/adminPassword
    3.  Add new company configurations in the ConfigShip.xml file.
    4.  Run the Installer process to create tenant-specific processes and services.
    5.  After the successful installation of the added company, sensitive information will be masked, and file names will be changed (e.g., ConfigSettings.xml converts to ConfigSettings_masked.xml, ConfigShip.xml converts to ConfigShip_masked.xml).

## For Existing Environment Setup with NU Already Installed (Manual Import)

## Setting Up SMTP Server

This section provides details on setting up the SMTP server, which is required to send emails to the recipients for error notifications.

>[!NOTE]
> If an SMTP service already exists for other integrations, you still need to set up this service for Ship integration.

To set up the SMTP server, perform the following:

1.  Open the **Smart Hub** repository, navigate to **Services**, and then select **SMTP Services**.

    ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/c7b9634ab7a86082bdfa9893165c1dd2.png)

2.  Open **MySmtpService**. It should resemble the image below:

    ![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/f01cb06eab3f1e75f8162ba93dae3860.png)

3.  Configure the following details:
    -   **From**: Name of the Sender.
    -   **From address**: Email address of the sender.
    -   **Email server**:
        -   **For Gmail**: smtp.gmail.com
        -   **For Outlook**: smtp.office365.com
    -   **Username**: Username for the sender's mail account.
    -   **Password**: If two-factor authentication is enabled, provide the application key. Otherwise, provide the email account password.
4.  Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

## Field Validations

When synchronization occurs from Aptean Ship to M2M, ensure that the following fields are filled in:

-   No. of Boxes
-   Freight Charges
-   Tracking Number
-   Shipment Weight
-   Shipping Via (this entry should be present in both M2M and Aptean Ship)

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Setting Up Company Name

Ensure that your company name is properly configured in Aptean Ship after installation or configuration.

![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/1628d33444934cd602126bd1d61588f2.png)

### Use Case 2: Syncing Source Fields

Make sure that information like Ship Via synchronizes correctly after setup. Only active Ship Vias are synced. You can view the Ship Via map using the 'carrier - service' filter in Aptean Ship. Key Ship Via details from M2M will appear in the Value Translations field.

### Use Case 3: Creating a New Shipping Record

When creating a new Shipping record, ensure all necessary details are included. Afterward, upload the record to Aptean Ship for processing.

![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/6b0b555e9f07278ab78bcf428a8bcc4f.png)

You'll find the uploaded document listed under your company name.

![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/1b6fadcd9df6c208e6a5f94357b977bf.png)

### Use Case 4: Editing Shipping Records

If you need to make changes to a Shipping record, simply edit it and upload the updated document to Aptean Ship. The system will ensure the changes are accurately reflected.

### Use Case 5: Completing Shipping Processes

After creating a Shipping record, complete the process by creating a Shipment.

![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/39f1fde8270b37295adc575eae8de79a.png)

Populate all necessary details from the uploaded document, including Ship Via and shipping rates.

![](../assets/install-and-config-guide/d4870e0b78d1709ca5cf3a4238fd5d98.png)

Once completed, the system will handle the rest, including updates to M2M fields.

Additionally:

-   Ensure the agent picks up the Shipment on the next scheduled pick-up.
-   Users will see shipping fields populated from Aptean Ship, including Ship Weight, Number of Boxes, Freight Charge, and Tracking Number.
-   Dependency on the M2M Processor Service is eliminated; instead, Smart Hub will update M2M fields directly.
-   If Custom Write-Back setup is configured, Ship Via changes from Aptean Ship should reflect in M2M.
