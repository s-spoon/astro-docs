You can use Request For Quotation (RFQ) to record vendors' price information.

**To work with RFQs**

1. [Add the RFQ](add-an-rfq.md).

2. [Print the RFQ and send it to the appropriate vendor(s)](rfq-report-rprfqd-page.md).

3. [When the vendor returns the completed RFQ, enter the RFQ prices you received into Made2Manage](record-prices-in-rfqs.md).

When you receive RFQs from all the vendors, you can compare quotations to determine the best vendor from which to purchase the item or service, and use the RFQ to create a purchase order.
