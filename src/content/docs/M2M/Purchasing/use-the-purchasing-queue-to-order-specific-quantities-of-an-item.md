When you view the purchasing queue, you may choose to purchase specific quantities of an item based only on a particular document. For example, you may want to place a purchase order for an item based on only one sales order.

Non-nettable quantities are not considered available. Therefore, the quantity available fields in the **Summary** and **Details** grids do not include non-nettable quantities.

Multidimensional inventory parts cannot be backflushed.
