You can change or remove an RFQ in **STARTED** status.

An RFQ can be modified irrespective of its Open / Started status as long as there are no recorded responses from the vendors (RFQRECP). Items can be added, deleted, breakpoints can be modified or deleted by making the breakpoint quantity zero (0).
