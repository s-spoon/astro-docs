Use the purchasing queue to quickly order one or more items.

Before you place a purchase order, assign a vendor and change the purchase order's status to Open.

Non-nettable quantities are not considered available. Therefore, the quantity available fields in the **Summary** and **Details** grids do not include non-nettable quantities.

Mutli-dimensional inventory parts cannot be backflushed.
