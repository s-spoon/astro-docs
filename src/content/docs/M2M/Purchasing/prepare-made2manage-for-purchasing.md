Before you can use Made2Manage for purchasing, you need to:

- Set vendor information so you can quickly locate the names and addresses of vendors from which your company requests quotations and purchases items and services.

- Set up purchasing categories so you can assign the proper general ledger accounts to all items, to customize purchasing categories for your purchasing system, and to group materials purchased for production and general operations.

You can also add part cross-references so you can effectively communicate with vendors and customers about parts and use your inventory most effectively.
