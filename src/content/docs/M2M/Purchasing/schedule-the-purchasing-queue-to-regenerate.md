You regenerate the purchasing queue to update it with the most current purchasing needs. You can schedule the purchasing queue to automatically regenerate on a schedule. For example, you can schedule the purchasing queue to regenerate each night at midnight. Then you can view the most current information in the morning.

Some users may not have permission to use the Command Scheduler. See your system administrator.

At least one machine must be in Command Processor mode for the regeneration to occur.
