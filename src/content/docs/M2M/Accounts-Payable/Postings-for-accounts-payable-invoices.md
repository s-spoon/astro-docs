An **Accounts Payable (AP)** invoice debits the **Received Goods** account and credits the **AP account**. This process follows for standard or **weighted average costing** methods.

The **weighted average** costing method calculates variances for costs when items are received.

### Sample Ledger for Accounts Payable Transaction:

| Date       | Transaction/Accounts        | Debit | Credit |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------|--------|
| April 1    | Accounts Payable Invoice     |       |        |
|            | Received Goods               | 44    |        |
|            | Accounts Payable             |       | 44     |

This shows how the AP transactions post when using the weighted average costing method.
