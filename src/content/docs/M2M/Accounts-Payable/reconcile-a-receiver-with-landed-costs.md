When you close receivers that contain items with landed costs, you transfer the remaining balance in the landed cost clearing account to the purchase price variance account.

Before you close the receiver, distribute the landed costs.

**To reconcile a receiver with landed costs**

1.  Open the **Reconcile Receiver (CLRECV)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Inventory** > **Receiving** > **Reconcile Receiver**.

    Or

    - Search for **CLRECV** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Reconcile Receiver**.

    The **Reconcile Receiver (CLRECV)** page appears.

2.  Click **Browse** on the **Toolbar**.

    The **Browse For Reconcile Receive**r window appears.

3.  Highlight a row and click **Select**. Or double-click the row to select.

4.  Review the **Reconciled** column to ensure that you reconciled landed costs for all items.

5.  To view distributed landed costs:

    1.  On the **Toolbar**, click **More Actions**.

    - Select More Actions > Actions > View Distribution Costs (VDCST).

    The **View Distribution Costs (VDCST)** window appears.

    1.  Review distributed costs.
   
    2.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Status** > **Closed**.

    If any landed costs have not been reconciled, a message appears. Click **No** to reconcile landed costs before closing the receiver. Click **Yes** to close the receiver without reconciling landed costs.

    To edit previously distributed costs, change the status of a receiver from **Closed** to **Open**.

    When you re-open a receiver, you can reverse postings to landed cost categories.
