## View accounts payable invoices paid to vendors that requested 1099 forms

Use the **Report 1099** page to generate report of all AP invoices which have been paid in a given time period for Vendors flagged as 'Send 1099'. This can be used to compute totals to be filled out on 1099 forms. Suggested usage would be to run this report to an Excel spreadsheet with 'Output' option being set to file. The spreadsheet can then be analyzed, deleting any items that should not be included on the 1099 form.

By default, generic filters are available to generate this report. You can use Advanced Filters to customize or expand your filter criteria.
This report does not include Advanced Filters feature.
