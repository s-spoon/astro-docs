Use the **Indented Costed Bills of Material** page to generate an indented costed Bill of Material. An indented costed bill of material details the cost of the parent part by showing the cost of each component part at each level.

>[!NOTE] After you roll up costs in the **Inventory Cost Roll Up (CRUP)** page, the costs in the **BOMICS** page is displayed based on the Yields in **RTG**.

- If the unit of measure is Each (EA) or Piece (PC), the Operation quantity will be rounded up to the next integer after the calculation with yield and used for computing the labor and overhead costs.

- If the unit of measure is other than EA or PC, the Operation quantity will remain as it is (decimal/integer) after the calculation and the same is used for computing the labor and overhead costs.
