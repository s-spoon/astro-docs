Setting up for physical inventory means specifying certain methods and preventing inventory transactions from occurring during the counting days (so that you have stable quantities to count). You can also specify the type of tags you want to print, including tags for all item master primary locations, locations with an on-hand balance, or both.

Pre-populated tags are not created for items with inventory on-hand balance of zero.

**To set up physical inventory**

1. Open the Phy Inventory Set-up (PHYSET) page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Inventory** > **Physical Inventory**.

    2. To create physical inventory tags for locations with an on-hand balance, select the **On Hand By Location** check box.

    2. If you do not want to create physical inventory tags for obsolete parts, select the **Exclude Obsolete Items** check box.

        If you select to create physical inventory tags for both item master primary locations and parts with an on-hand balance, and you want to exclude obsolete items, select both **Exclude Obsolete Items** check boxes.

8. To zero out all the existing on-hand inventory quantities and on-hand dimensions for multi-dimensional inventory (MDI) parts, click the **Zero Existing Balance** on the **Toolbar**.

9. Click **Save** on the **Toolbar** to keep the physical inventory setup.

    The next step is to assign ranges of counting tags to areas or supervisors.
