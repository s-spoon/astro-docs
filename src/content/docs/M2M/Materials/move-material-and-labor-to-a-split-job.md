You can transfer a specific amount of material and labor to a split job order.

**To move materials and **labor** to a split job**

1. Open the **Job Order Splitting** page for the job to use and prepare to move materials and labor.

2. Click the **Material** tab to transfer material.

    Or click the **Labor** tab to transfer labor.

3. Click **Change Qty to Transfer to Zero** if you only want to transfer a few items.

    Or click **Change Qty to Transfer to Remaining** if you want to transfer the total quantity for most of the items.

4. For each item for which to transfer a specific quantity:

    1. Click the field in the **Quantity To Transfer** column for the line item to transfer.

    2. In the field, type the quantity to transfer. Or, click the icon at the end of the field to display the calculator. Enter the required value.

5. Click **Do Transfer**.

    Labor costs for the job order split and transfer to the new job order, but labor hours performed towards the original job order remain the same.

    When reviewing the **Order Cost Detail Transactions (RPJOTS)** report for either the parent job or the new split job, any material and labor moved to the new job will show in a separate section on the report called **Labor-Job Splitting** instead of under the material or labor sections of the report.
