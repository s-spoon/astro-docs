The next step in preparing for physical inventory is to assign ranges of numbered counting tags to areas that contain parts or to supervisors.

Before you do this, you must set up the physical inventory.

**To assign tags to areas or supervisors**

1. Open the **Phy Inventory Tag Control (PHYTAG)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Inventory** > **Physical Inventory** > **Phy Inventory Tag Control**.

    Or

    - Search for **PHYTAG** or **Phy Inventory Tag Control** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Phy Inventory Tag Control.**

    The **Phy Inventory Tag Control (PHYTAG)** page appears.

2. To assign a range of tags:

    1. In the **Facility** list, select the facility.

    2. On the child toolbar, click **New**.

    3. In the **Increment New Records By** field, select a different number to change the standard number of tags in a range.

        Later you can change the number of tags in this particular range.

    4. In the **Issued To** field, type the initials of the employee to whom you are assigning the tags.

3. Specify the area:

    1. In the **Site** field, type a code to identify the building or work site that contains the parts.

    2. In the **Area** field, type a code to identify the area, in the building or work site that contains the parts.

        An **area** you assign a range of tags to, such as a particular aisle, can consist of multiple inventory locations. Or, you can pre-assign an area's tag range to a single inventory location when you add individual tag records.

    3. In the **Type** list, select **Tag**.

4. To adjust the range of tag numbers:

    1. In the **Beginning** field, select the first number.

    2. In the **Ending** field, select the last number.

    3. Select the **Add Now** check box.

    4. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to keep the assignment.

5. To change the assignment of a range of tags:

    1. Select the row that shows the assignment.

    2. Make your changes.

    3. On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to keep your changes.

6. To delete the assignment of a range of tags:

    1. Select the row that shows the assignment.

    2. Click the **Delete** icon under the **Action** column.

        A message, *Are you sure you would like to delete this record?* appears.

    3. Click **OK** to continue.

        Click **Cancel** to retain the values.

The next step is to [add a record for each tag](add-tag-records.md).
