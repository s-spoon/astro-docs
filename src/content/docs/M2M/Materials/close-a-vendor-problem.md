When you record an action for a vendor problem and mark the next step as resolved, Made2Manage closes the problem. But you can also close a problem without recording a resolving action.

**To close a vendor problem**

1. Open the **Vendor Service Request (SYCSLV)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Quality > Vendor Service Request.**

    Or

    - Search for **SYCSLV** or **Vendor Service Request** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Vendor Service Request**.

    The **Vendor Service Request (SYCSLV)** page appears.

2. On the **Toolbar**, click **Browse**.

    The **Browse For Vendor Service Request** window appears.

3. Select the row that contains the required service request, and click **Select**. Or, double-click the row that contains the required service request.

    Click **Cancel** to exit from the **Browse For Vendor Service Request** window.

4. Click the **Status** button, and select **Closed**.
