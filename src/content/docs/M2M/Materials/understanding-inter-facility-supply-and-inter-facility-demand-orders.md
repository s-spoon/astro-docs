Use an inter-facility supply order (ISO) when you need **Make** or **Stock** items from another facility. When you change an inter-facility supply order's status to OPEN, Made2Manage creates an inter-facility demand order (IDO) for the source facility. The source facility then processes the IDO, and eventually ships the item to the destination facility.

Made2Manage stores inter-facility material requirements in the inter-facility supply order queue. This makes it easy to determine the inter-facility material requirements and quickly open inter-facility supply orders.


    If you need items from another facility but do not have an associated sales or job order, you can add ISOs manually. Ensure to select the appropriate source and destination facilities when adding the ISO.

    You can check the progress of ISOs and IDOs in transit between the source and destination facilities.


    You can assign costs associated with parts acquired from other facilities to either the shipping or receiving facility.
