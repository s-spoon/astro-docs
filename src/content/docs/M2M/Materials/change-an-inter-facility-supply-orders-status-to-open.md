An inter-facility supply order (ISO) is created when you want materials from another facility. When you change an inter-facility supply order's status to open, Made2Manage creates an inter-facility demand order (IDO) for the facility that will fulfill the demand.

**To change an inter-facility supply order's status to open**

1. Open the **Inter-Facility Supply Order (ISO)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Planning** > **Inter-Facility Supply Order**.

    Or

    - Search for **ISO** or **Inter-Facility Supply Order** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Inter-Facility Supply Order.**

        The **Inter-Facility Supply Order (ISO)** page appears.

2. Click the **Status** drop-down button and select **Open**.

    Made2Manage creates an IDO for the source facility.
