The first step in preparing for cycle counting is to select either to store or remove tag records after you post them.

**To select an archive method**

1. Open the Phy Inventory Set-up (PHYSET) page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Inventory** > **Physical Inventory**.

    Or

    - Search for **PHYSET** or **Phy Inventory Set-up** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Phy Inventory Set-up.**

   The **Phy Inventory Set-up (PHYSET)** page appears.

2. Make the necessary changes.

3. Click the **Facility** arrow and select the facility .

4. Click the **Archive Method** arrow and select whether to store or remove the tag records after you have posted them.

    The other boxes in the page may show information about a previous physical inventory. For cycle counting, Made2Manage uses only your archive method option.

5. Click the **Zero Existing Balance** on the **Toolbar** to zero out all existing on-hand inventory quantities and on-hand dimensions for multi-dimensional inventory (MDI) parts.

6. Click the **Data Integrity check** on the **Toolbar** to update the on-hand quantity in item master and the on-hand tables. This will post the difference in OCDIST.

    A message, '*This operation will update the on hand quantity in item master and on hand tables and post the difference in OCDIST. Please confirm this action by pressing OK.*' appears.

    Click **OK** to confirm the operation.

    Click **Cancel** to exit.

7. Click **Save** to keep the physical inventory setup.

The next step is to [Set cycle counting rules](set-cycle-counting-rules.md).
