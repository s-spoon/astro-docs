A product class represents a group of similar inventory items on financial statements and reports. Product classes help track revenues, costs, and profits. Group codes exist within product classes. They do not appear on financial statements, but they do appear on several inventory reports.

**To set up a group code**

1. Open the **Group Codes (GCOD)** page.

    - Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup**> **System** > **Group Codes**.

    Or

    - Search for **GCOD** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Group Codes**.

   The **Group Codes (GCOD)** page appears.

2. Click **New** on the **Toolbar**.

    Or to base this group code on the one the page shows, click the **Copy**.

3. In the **Group Code** box, type the new group code.

4. In the **Description** box, type a description of the group code.

5. Click **Save** to keep the group code.
