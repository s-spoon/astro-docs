Made2Manage helps you determine inter-facility material needs based on your company's existing inventory and demand from sales orders and job orders. Made2Manage stores inter-facility material needs in the inter-facility supply order queue, which makes it easy to determine inter-facility material needs and quickly open inter-facility supply orders.

- How does Made2Manage determine the items you need?

If you need items without an associated sales or job order from another facility, you can enter ISOs manually. In this situation, be sure to select the appropriate source and destination facilities when adding the ISO.
