After you record inventory counts and verify them, you can approve them by tag record. And as necessary, you must mark tag records as missing or void. You can post only approved tag records to on-hand inventory and the general ledger. For example, you may want to approve tags 1-200, mark tag 201 as missing, approve tags 202-399, and mark tag 400 as void.

**To approve a range of tags**

1. Open the **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update (PHYINV)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Inventory** > **Physical Inventory** > **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update**.

    Or

    - Search for **PHYINV** or **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update.**

        The **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update (PHYINV)** page appears.

2. In **Facility** list, select the facility.

3. Click the **Status** button. The **Change Status** window appears.

4. In the **Change Status to** list, make appropriate changes:

    - Select **Started to Approved**, to approve the tags.

    - Select **Unused to Missing**, to mark the tags as missing.

    - Select **StartedorApproved to Void** or **Unused to Void** as appropriate, to mark the tags as void.

5. Click **Select from a list of eligible Tags**.

6. Select the **Print the Update Report Error** check box, to print a report of the reasons why any tags cannot be approved.

7. Click **OK**.

    The **Sort** (PHYSRT) window appears. Use this window to select tag ranges to approve.
