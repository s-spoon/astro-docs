After you record inventory counts and verify them, you can approve them by tag record. And as necessary, you must mark tag records as missing or void. You can post only approved tag records to on-hand inventory and the general ledger. For example, you may want to approve tags 1-200, mark tag 201 as missing, approve tags 202-399, and mark tag 400 as void.

**To approve one tag's **inventory** count**

1. Open the **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update (PHYINV)** page.

    - Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Inventory** > **Physical Inventory** > **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update**.

    Or

    - Search for **PHYINV** or **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update.**

        The **Physical Inventory - Tag Entry/Update (PHYINV)** page appears.

2. In the **Facility** list, select the facility.

3. In the **Tag No** field, type or select the required tag number.

4. Click the **Status** button. The **Change Status** window appears.

5. In the **Change Status to** list, specify the change:

    - Select **Started to Approved**, to approve the tags.

    - Select **Unused to Missing**, to mark the tags as missing.

    - Select **Started** **or** **Approved to Void** or **Unused to Void** as appropriate, to mark the tags as void.

6. Click **Current Tag records only**.
