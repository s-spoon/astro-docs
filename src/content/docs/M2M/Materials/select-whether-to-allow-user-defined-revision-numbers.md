User-defined revision numbers let you assign your own revision numbers to parts. You can change user-defined revision numbers at any time in many Made2Manage windows. Parts using user-defined revision numbers do not use **Engineering Change Management (ECM)** and because of this you do not create a revision history when changing parts with user-defined revision numbers. However, you can use both ECM and user-defined revision numbers simultaneously in Made2Manage. This lets you track revision history and maintain strict change control on some parts while not requiring such control for other parts.

**To select whether to allow user-defined revision numbers**

1. Open the **Production (CSPROD)** page.

    - Select **Utilities** > **Company Setup** > **Module Setup** > **Production**.

    Or

    - Search for **CSPROD** or **Production** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Production**.

    The **Production (CSPROD)** page appears.

2. Click the **ECM** tab.

3. Make the necessary changes.

4. Select the **Allow User-Defined Revision Numbers** check box.

    Once you enable the user-defined revision numbers feature, you cannot turn it **OFF**.

5. Click **Save** on the **Toolbar** to keep your changes.
