Use the **Revision Type Mass Change** page to change the revision type for a part or a group of parts. You can change existing parts from standard revision numbers to *user-defined revision numbers*. 

To help you decide which parts or groups of parts for which you wish to change the revision type, you can view or print a report of parts with multiple revisions.

Parts using user-defined revision numbers are not eligible for *Engineering Change Management (ECM) (A feature of Made2Manage that manages the process of engineering changes in standard item records. It provides a way to control changes you make to item masters, standard routings and bills of material; and lets you track changes to item masters, sales orders, quotes, purchase orders, bills of material, and routings.)* and do not create a *revision history Information about when and why you made changes to some kinds of information in Made2Manage.*.
