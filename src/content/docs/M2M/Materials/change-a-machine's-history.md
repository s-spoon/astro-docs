A machine's history record lists all component parts associated with that machine and all related activities. It is important to keep the record since the record keeps tracks of why and when a part was installed, repaired, or replaced. This can be useful information if questions arise regarding the service of a specific machine.

**To change a machine's history**

1. Open the **Machine(MACHSER)** page.

    - Select **Customer Relationship Management** > **Master Data** > **Field Service** > **Machine**.

    - Search for **MACHSER** or **Machine** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Machine**.

        The **Machine(MACHSER)** page appears.

2. Click the **Machine History** tab, and click on the line in the table that you want to change.

3. Make the necessary changes.

4. At the bottom of the screen you can add or change the **Serial Number**, the **Item Reference**, or any of the four types of notes. You can also change the **Quantity**, or **Unit of Measure**.
