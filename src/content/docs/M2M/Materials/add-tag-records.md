The next step in preparing for physical inventory is to add a record for each inventory tag and to optionally pre-assign inventory locations to ranges of tags.

Before you do this, you must set up the physical inventory and assign tags to areas or supervisors.

**To add **tag** records**

1. In the **Phy Inventory Tag Control (PHYTAG)** page, in the **Facility** list, select the facility.

2. Click **New** on the child toolbar.

3. Select the **Add Tag Records Now** check box.

    Made2Manage adds a record for each tag in each range -- if the document status is **Newly issued** and if a check mark appears in the box in the **Add Now** column.

4. To pre-assign the range of tags that Made2Manage specifies to the parts in a particular location:

    1. Select the **Specific Location?** check box.

    2. In the **Select Location** section, in the **Location** list, select the location.

    The next step is to print inventory tags.
