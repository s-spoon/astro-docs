An inventory location is any large area, such as a warehouse or room, where you store raw material, component parts, or finished goods. Each inventory location can maintain its own material issues and receipts, giving you an accurate summary of inventory levels for each location.

You can further divide an inventory location by assigning items to bins within the location.
