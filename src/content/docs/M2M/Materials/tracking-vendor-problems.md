Occasionally you may encounter a problem with a vendor. For instance, you may receive a faulty part or the wrong part. You can track a vendor problem from your initial inquiry to the vendor through the problem's resolution.

**To track a vendor problem**

1. Record your [initial inquiry to the vendor](add-a-vendor-problem.md).

2. [Record each action you or the vendor takes to resolve the problem](record-the-actions-you-or-the-vendor-takes-to-resolve-a-vendor-problem.md).


3. Record the problem's resolution by [recording an action and marking it resolved and close the problem.](record-the-actions-you-or-the-vendor-takes-to-resolve-a-vendor-problem.md).

    Or [simply close the problem](close-a-vendor-problem.md).

    You can check vendor problems by generating reports.
