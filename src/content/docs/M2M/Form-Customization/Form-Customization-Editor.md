The tools used to develop customizations include a built-in visual designer, maintenance screens, metadata synchronization utility and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.

## Form Designer

The designer is built into the Made2Manage executable. The designer allows editing of **Layout Models** and **Entity Models**. The designer comprises of three components that includes a **form design surface**, **model view**, and **property** window.

 for layout changes using drag/drop and grouping capabilities. The model view allows for entities and attributes to be created or deleted. Finally, the property window is used for changing attribute values.

The **Layout Model** and **Entity Model** are written to files in the extensions folder once the changes are made and saved.

You can access the designer from two locations: from the **Screen Maintenance** window or from the **Active Window** tab on the main toolbar.
