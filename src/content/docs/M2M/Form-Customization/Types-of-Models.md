There are three types of models.

| Models     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Layout     | The metadata definitions are referred to as **Layout Models**. A Layout Model consists of a Form (default View), **Index** and may include one or more **Alternate Views**. The Layout Models are stored as files and embedded into the core Made2Manage solution libraries. The **Form and Alternate Views** represent windows in the Made2Manage product. These views describe the fields, present on a form and how they are arranged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Entity     | An **Entity Model** defines a business objectâ€™s data structure. It is similar to a database with **Entities** (tables), **Attributes** (columns and column constraints) and **Relationships** (table constraints). An **Entity Model** consists of one or more **Entities** where each **Entity includes a collection of Attributes**.  An **Entity Model** may also contain Entity Relationships if the model contains more than one Entity. The **Entity Models** are stored as files and embedded into the core Made2Manage solution libraries.  The **Entity Model** is the logical representation of a subset of the database.It includes table/column mapping specifications to facilitate  reading/writing data to and from the underlying data store. |
| Navigation | Use the application menu or **Transfer** window to navigate to a form. The information about the menu structure and the forms available in the **Transfer** window are part of the navigation metadata. This metadata is stored in the database table **UTSEC** and contains details such as the visual parent (menu) and a designation on whether the **Page** is accessible from the **Transfer** window. By default all companies and users have access to all forms and menus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
