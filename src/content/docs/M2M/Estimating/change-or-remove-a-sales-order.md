A sales order (SO) specifies a customer's request to buy an item from your company. You can change or remove a sales order provided you have not created a job order from it.

## To change a sales order

1.  Select the required sales order.

2.  Make the changes.

**Note:**

- You cannot change the jurisdiction of the sales order item if it has been invoiced or if a shipper has been created for it. A warning message is displayed when the sales order jurisdiction is changed, and the sales items have an existing shipper or invoice. However, you can change the jurisdiction of the sales order.

- You cannot change the SO status of an inactive customer. An error message *'Cannot Change Status. Customer is INACTIVE.'* appears.

3.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to save your changes, else click **Cancel**.

**Note:**

For any Inter-Company SO edits or status change, these must be updated manually in the corresponding company.

## To remove the sales order

**Note:** 
You cannot delete a sales order that is in **Open** status.

1.  Select the required sales order.

2.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Delete**.

A message, '*Preparing to delete this information. Are you sure?*' appears.

1.  Click **OK** to delete the sales order, else click **Cancel**.
