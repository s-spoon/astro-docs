You can add revision numbers to your quotation and sales orders as you change them.

## To revise a quotation or sales order

1.  Open the quotation or sales order.

2.  Click **Revision** on the **Toolbar**.

3.  Type a reason for the revision in the **Reason** box.

4.  If you want to print a copy of the revised quotation, select the **Print Order Acknowledgment** check box.

5.  Click the **OK** to enable the revision. Click **Cancel** to exit from the page.

    The revision number increases by one. If the **Print Quote Acknowledgment** or **Print Order Acknowledgment** check box contains a checkmark, the quotation acknowledgment prints to the default printer.
