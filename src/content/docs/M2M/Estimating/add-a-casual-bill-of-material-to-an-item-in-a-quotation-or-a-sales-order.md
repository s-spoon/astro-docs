A casual bill of material roughly estimates the cost of materials needed to produce a part. For parts that do not already have standard bills of material, you can add casual bills of materials to your quotations and sales orders.

If a part has a detailed bill of material, you cannot create a casual bill of material.

1.  Open the quotation or sales order.

2.  Click the **Items** tab.

5.  Click the ellipsis under the **Action** column.
    
    1.  Select **Grid Accessories** > **Grid Actions** > **Casual Bill Of Mater**.

        The **Quote Casual Bill of Material** or **Sales Order Casual Bill of Material** page appears.

6.  For each item to add:

    1.  On the grid toolbar, click **New**.

    Or click **Copy** to add an item based on the highlighted item in the casual bill.

    2.  In the **Description** field, type the part's description.

    3.  In the **Material Cost** field, type the part's cost.

7.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to keep the changes.
