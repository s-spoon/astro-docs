The detailed bill of material lists all the parts and assemblies needed to produce a part. For parts that do not already have a standard bill of material, you can add a detailed bill of material to your quo- tations and sales orders.

## To add a detailed bill of material

2.  Add the detailed bill:
    1.  Click the **Items** tab.
    2.  In the grid, select the row that contains the item.
    2.  Click the ellipsis under the **Action** column.
    3.  Select **Grid Actions** > **Detailed Bill of Material**.

        The **Sales Order Detailed BOM** or the **Quote Detailed Bill of Material** page appears.

3.  Select the line before which to add the component.

4.  Add a part:

    » Add a part from scratch

    » Add a part based on the highlighted item, a job order, or an item in an estimate file.

4.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Save** to keep the item.

5.  Repeat **steps 4 and 5** for each part or assembly to add.
