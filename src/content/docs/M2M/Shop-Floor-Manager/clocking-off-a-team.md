You can clock off a team as the team lead or as a team member. If you are clocking off a team as the lead, you must either designate another person as the team lead, or close the team.

To perform this labor function, **Clock On Team** must be available in the **Work Center Console**.

## To Clock off a Team

1.  Open the **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page.

    Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Shop Floor** > **Work Center Console**.

    *Or*

    Search for **SFMWC** or **Work Center Console** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Work Center Console**.

    The **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page appears.

2.  Select the Work Center you want to work.

    The work centers assigned to the user in the **[User Work Centers](user-work-centers.md)** tab of the

    **Setup** page are available for selection.

3.  Click **Clock Off Team**.

    The **Clock Off Team** window appears in the right hand pane of the **Work Center Console** page.

4.  Enter the **Employee Number** you were assigned in Made2Manage. The system displays the **First Name** and **Last Name**.
5.  If you are clocking off the team as a team member, and not a lead: Click **Clock Off** to clock off the team, else click **Cancel**.

    You will be clocked off the job orders that the team is clocked on to, and removed from the list of team members.

6.  If you are clocking off the team as the team lead,

    Click **Clock Off** to clock off the team, else click **Cancel**.

If you are not the last employee to clock off the team, you must designate another member of the team as the team lead before you can clock off the team.

If you do not want to designate someone else as the team lead, click **Close Team** to close the team. When you close the team, all remaining team members are clocked out of the job orders for the team. The team lead must then clock the team off its job orders and enter the appropriate quantities.
