Shop Floor Manager provides a way to consolidate the information and processes you need to manage your shop floor efficiently. The shop floor supervisor has a **Supervisor Console** to view the status of job orders, material, labor, and manage shop floor functions such as issuing material, changing job statuses, and prioritizing work.

At the work center level, shop floor personnel have their own **Work Center Console** so they can work in a "paperless" environment, and view the information they need to work on job orders online. They can also report labor via a computer with a mouse or touch screen.
