The **Supervisor Console** makes it easy to access all the information that you need to monitor work in the Shop Floor. Since information is updated based on the interval that you specify, you can be certain that what you are looking at is current.

The transactions you perform in **Supervisor Console** go directly to Made2Manage (**JOISS** and so on) and not through the bar code posting program.

## To use the Supervisor Console

1.  Open the **Supervisor Console (SFMS)** page.

    Select Production Management > Production Transactions > Shop Floor > Supervisor Console.

    *Or*

     *Search for* **SFMS** *or* **Supervisor Console** *in the* **Navigation box** *and then select* **Supervisor Console***.*

    The **Supervisor Console (SFMS)** page appears.
