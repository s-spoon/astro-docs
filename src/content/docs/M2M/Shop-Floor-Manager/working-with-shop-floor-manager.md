Before you begin using Shop Floor Manager, you should understand how to use the information in the windows, including sorting, grouping, and filtering it. You can also print Shop Floor Manager information, or export it to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

Permissions to access the Shop Floor Manager windows are based on a user's Made2Manage permissions. If a user has all permissions, or all PRODAT permissions, they automatically have permissions to all SFM windows. To change SFM user permissions, open the **User Management** (**User**) page in Made2Manage and click **Permissions**. For more information on assigning permissions to users, refer to **Setting User Permissions**.

>[!note]
>* The transactions performed in the **Supervisor Console** go directly into Made2Manage (**JOISS** and so on).<br><li>The transactions performed in the **Work Center Console** are processed through the bar code posting program and then updates are made to Made2Manage.
