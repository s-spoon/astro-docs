The Shop Floor Manager **Work Center Console** comes with a keypad that you can use with a touch screen monitor or a mouse. The keypad displays either numeric or alphanumeric characters, depending on the value required in the current field. When the display is numeric only, the keypad also functions as a Calculator.

## To use the Shop Floor Manager Keypad

1.  To use the keypad, press/click in the data entry field.
    -   If you checked the **No Keyboard** option in the **[User Preferences](setting-user-preferences.md)** window, you only need to click in the field once. If you did not check that option, you must double-click in the field.
    -   If you click in a data entry field that only accepts numbers, only the numeric portion of the keypad displays. If you click in a data entry field that accepts both numbers and alpha characters, the entire keypad is displayed.
2.  Input the numbers and/or letters you need to complete the field entry.
    -   If you have a touch screen keypad, use your finger to press the characters.
    -   If you have a mouse, click on the characters.
    -   Press/click **Backspace** if you need an empty space in the entry.
    -   Press/click **Backspace** to erase the last character you entered.
    -   Press/click **Clear** to clear the entire entry.
3.  Press/click **OK** to save the entry, else press/click **Cancel**. The keypad window is closed.

    You can use the keypad as a calculator when you are in a field that requires a numeric value (only the numbers display on the keypad).

## To use the Calculator

1.  Enter the first number in the calculation.
2.  Press/click the function you want to perform.
3.  Enter the next number in the calculation.
4.  Enter any remaining functions and numbers.
5.  Press/click to complete the calculation.
