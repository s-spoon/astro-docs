When it is time to go on break you will clock on your break. This is important so Shop Floor Manager can track the time as not worked, and so no jobs are charged for this time.

-   If you clock on a break, but forget to clock off, the next time you clock on or off a job order or team, the end of break is automatically recorded with that time. If a Team Lead is clocking on a JO, only that person will be clocked off break.
-   You can only perform this labor function if the **Break** button is available in the **Work Center Con- sole**.

1.  Open the **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page.
