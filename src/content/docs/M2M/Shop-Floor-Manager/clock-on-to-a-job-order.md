When you are ready to begin work, you should clock on the job order where you are going to work.

You can only perform this labor function if the **Clock On JO** is available in the **Work Center Console** page.

To Clock on a Job Order

1.  Open the **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page.

    Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Shop Floor** > **Work Center Console**.

    *Or*

      Search for **SFMWC** or **Work Center Console** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Work Center Console** .

    The **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page appears.

2.  Select the Work Center you want to work.

    The work centers assigned to the user on the **[User Work Centers](user-work-centers.md)** tab of the **Setup** page are available for selection.

3.  Click **Clock On JO**.

    The **Clock On Jo** window appears in the right hand pane of the **Work Center Console** page.

4.  Enter the **Employee Number** you were assigned in Made2Manage.

    The system displays the **First Name** and **Last Name**. If you are clocking on the job as a team lead, the team name will display above the employee name.

5.  Click on the method you want to use to report labor:
    -   **Regular** - Record straight time spent working on only one job. When you clock on as **Regular**, you cannot clock on another job until you clock off the first job.
    -   **Serial** - Record time spent on several short-run operations. The system calculates the amount of time spent on each job based on the quantity completed for each operation. When you select **Serial**, you can clock on more than one job at a time.
    -   **Parallel** - Record time working on more than one job at a time. The system will allocate the amount of time spent on each job. When you select **Parallel**, you can clock on more than one job at a time.
    -   **Adtl Op** - Record time spent on a work center other than the one currently selected. When you select **Adtl Op**, the work center currently selected defaults, but you can change it to a different work center. You can only clock on one operation at a time.

        After you click on a **Labor** button, the other buttons are greyed out. If you need to change the labor type, click on the **Reset** icon, and all the buttons will become available so you can change your selection.

1.  In the left-hand pane, click the job you want to work on.
2.  Click **Complete Clock On** to clock on the job, else click **Cancel**.
3.  If you forgot to clock in for the day, a message displays to ask if you also want to clock in for the day.
4.  Click **Yes** to clock in for the day and on the job at the same time.
