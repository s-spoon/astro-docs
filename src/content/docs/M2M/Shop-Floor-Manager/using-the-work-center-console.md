The **Work Center Console** makes it easy to access all the information that you need to work on jobs.  You can clock in and out for the day, clock on and off teams, clock on and off jobs, and clock on and off breaks from the work center console. By making this information easily available right on the shop floor, you can eliminate confusion and work smarter and faster.

The transactions that you perform in the **Work Center Console** are processed through the bar code posting program and then updates are made to Made2Manage.

The **Work Center Console** page consists of three areas:

-   The top part of the window displays the Work Center. From the **Work Center**

    list, select the work center you want to work with.

-   The three buttons on the top that allow you to select the type of jobs you want to view in the grid. Click on one of the following buttons to select the jobs you want to view:

    - **JOs Arriving** - The **JOs Arriving** grid lists the jobs that are currently in another work center but will be coming to this work center.

    - **JO Queue** - The **JO Queue** grid lists the jobs that are ready for work to begin.

    - **Indirect JOs** - The **Indirect JOs** grid lists the operations on an internal-use job only when there are operation notes on that specific operation step in the job order.

    >[!Note]
    >Internal-Use jobs that do not have an operation note are shown in the JOs Arriving
grid and the JO Queue grid.


Select a job from the grid, and click the ellipsis under the **Action** column. The following options are available: **Job Order Detail**, **Job Order Status**, **JO Material Available**, **JO Material Issue**, **Assign Lot/SNs**, **Production Inspection**, and **JO Document Attachments**.

The **Job Operation Detail** pane displays detailed information about the job selected on the left-hand side including the JO memo, and shop notes on the JO and operation level.
