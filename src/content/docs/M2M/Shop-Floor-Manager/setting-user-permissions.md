User permissions are part of the system's security. To protect sensitive business data, you can control the pages that each user can use.

Permissions to access the **Shop Floor Manager** pages are based on a user's Made2Manage permissions. If a user has all permissions, or all **PRODAT** permissions, they automatically have per- missions to all the **SFM** pages.

If you decide to change permissions for either the **Supervisor Console** page or the **Work Center Console** page, then users will have limited access to these pages.

## To set user permissions

1.  Open the **User Management (USER)** page.
    1.  *Select* **Utilities** > **Maintenance** > **User Management** .

        *Or*

    2.  *Search for* **USER** *or* **User Management** *in the* **Navigation box** *and then select* User Management.

   The **User Management (USER)** page appears.

1.  On the **Toolbar**, click **More Actions**.
2.  Select **More Actions** > **Actions** > **Permission**. The **User Permissions** page appears.

    Use the **User Permissions (PERM)** page in **Made2Manage** to control the pages each user can use in Shop Floor Manager. All **SFM** pages fall under the **PRODAT** group of the grid in the **Permissions** section.
