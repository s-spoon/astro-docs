When you are ready to begin work for the day, you can clock in using the **Work Center Console**. Depending on your **Work Center Console** settings, you will clock in using the touch screen keypad or the keyboard.

If you forget to clock in for the day, and you try to clock on a job, a message displays to ask if you also want to clock in for the day. Click **Yes** to clock in for the day and on the job at the same time.

## To Clock in for the Day

1.  Open the **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page.

    Select **Production Management** > **Production Transactions** > **Shop Floor** > **Work Center Console**.

    *Or*

      Search for **SFMWC** or **Work Center Console** in the **Navigation box** and then select **Work Center Console**.

    The **Work Center Console (SFMWC)** page appears.

2.  On the **Toolbar**, click **Clock In**. The **Clock In** window appears.
3.  Enter the **Employee Number** you were assigned in Made2Manage.

    >[!Important] 
    >When the button next to the **Employee Number** field is **Scan On**, then if a prefix character exists in the value entered in the **Employee Number** field, it is removed. To retain the prefix character, type the prefix character twice. For example, if you want to enter Employee Number as **E123**, type **EE123**. Else, the Employee Number value is taken only as **123**.

    The system displays the **First Name** and **Last Name**.

4.  Click **Complete Clock In** to clock in under this employee number, else click **Cancel**.
