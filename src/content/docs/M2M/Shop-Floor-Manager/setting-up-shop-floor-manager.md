The Shop Floor Manager is designed to streamline the information and processes needed for effective shop floor management.
# Key Features
Supervisor Dashboard: Supervisors can easily monitor the status of job orders, materials, and labor.

Management Responsibilities: Supervisors handle essential functions such as issuing materials, updating job statuses, and prioritizing tasks.

Work Center Interfaces: Shop floor personnel have access to their own consoles, allowing them to operate in a paperless environment. They can view job order information online and report labor using a computer, mouse, or touchscreen.

After you install Shop Floor Manager, you must configure the status generation service, and configure its settings. In addition, you can set up teams and designate team leads.

The status generation service generates material statuses automatically at a user-specified interval. You use the M2M Shop Floor Manager Status Engine Configuration window to determine how the service operates.

# Setup

The **Setup** (**SFMSETUP**) page applies the settings you want to use for Shop Floor Manager. These settings apply to all Shop Floor Manager users. There are seven tabs in the **Setup** page:

**Setup 1**  

* **Facility Setup**

*  **Company Setup**  

**Setup 2**     

* **User Work Centers**
* **Teams**     
* **Team Leaders**
* **Auto Teams** 
* **Part Exclusion**             


Use the **User Preferences** (**SFMUPREF**) page to select the settings you want to use when you sign in under a specific user ID. Each user's settings are unique.

>[!Note:]
>Permissions to access the **Shop Floor Manager** pages are based on a user's **Made2Manage** permissions. If a user has all permissions, or all **PRODAT** permissions, they automatically have permissions to all SFM pages. To change SFM user permissions, open **User Management** (**USER**) page in Made2Manage, and click **Permission**.
