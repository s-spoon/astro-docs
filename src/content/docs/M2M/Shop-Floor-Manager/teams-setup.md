A team is a group of employees who work together on a Job Order. A team is formed as employees clock on the team. By using teams, you eliminate the need for individual team members to clock on and off jobs, because the team leader will clock on and off jobs for the entire team. Team members just need to clock in and out for the day, and clock on and off their breaks.

Use the **Teams** tab in the **Setup** (**SFMSETUP**) page to add, edit, or delete a team.

## To set up teams

1.  Open the **Setup (SFMSETUP)** page.
