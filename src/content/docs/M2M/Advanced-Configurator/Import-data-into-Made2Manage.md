Customers who are using Made2Manage 6.01 with APC Interface must migrate to Made2Manage 7.0. 
- Ensure CS Portal is installed and configured. This helps you to send data to **custom_db** database.  
 
- To identify a Sales Order from QUOTE, **Q** is prefixed to the **Quote Number**.  
  
  
Made2Manage picks data from the ELT tables (**eltbom**, **elthdr**,
**eltitm**, **eltrtg**) and imports them as either Sales or Quote depending on the prefix. For steps, see [View or delete Transaction Error details](View-or-delete-Transaction-Error-details).
