As documents are processed in Invoice Automation, they will acquire tags to help categorise them. These are visible in line with the document name.

Some Tags, for example the Template Name & Vendor Name have additional options and can be clicked on, these will allow you to edit the template & search for other documents from that vendor respectively.

Tags can also be used in [Workflow Approvals](../settings/workflows/approvals.md) as a criteria for capture.
