The actions menu is accessed by the 3 dots at the top right & contains options relevant to managing the document, some of these options are shared with the [Document List View](../document-list-view/contents.md) & will be omitted here.

-	Dispute: Places the document on dispute with a reason, these reasons can either be automatically acquired from your ERP solution (if supported) or typed in manually. NOTE: Disputed documents will still be exported to the ERP solution, however they will be flagged as disputed.
-	Approval History: A list of previous approvers for the document, for further information please see  [Workflow Approvals](../settings/workflows/approvals.md).
-	Ignored Validation Errors: A list of previously ignored/accepted validation errors for more information please see the [Validation Errors](../document-validation-errors.md).
-	User Hold (Deprecated): Place the document into a held state preventing it from being exported. NOTE: This option is deprecated & will be removed in a future release, please use the [Workflow Approvals](../settings/workflows/approvals.md) feature. 
-	Mark as Unseen: Re-marks this document as unseen to other users placing it back to the top of the unseen document list.
-	Convert to Purchase/Expense Invoice: Converts the current invoice to a Purchase/Expense Invoice depending on its current type. This will add/remove the Purchase Order Number field & add/remove the Expense GL Account Field on each line. NOTE: This feature is only available on documents scanned with an Invoice type template.
