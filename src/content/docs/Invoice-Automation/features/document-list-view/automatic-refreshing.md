In some circumstances the document view will automatically refresh as new data becomes available. Currently this will occur after a document has been uploaded and is in the ‘Uploaded’ state. As thumbnails & document information becomes available the image will be updated and the status will change to reflect its processed state.

Data that will automatically refresh is denoted by a circle containing the bouncing dots.
