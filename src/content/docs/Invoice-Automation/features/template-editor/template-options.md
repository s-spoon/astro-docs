-	Vendor: Name of the vendor uploaded from your ERP solution to link this template to. This will be used to find relevant Purchase Orders or Transactions for the document.
-	Additional Vendors: A list of additional vendors that Invoice Automation can use to find the Purchase Order for Purchase Invoice type documents. This feature is used for Buying Groups where the Purchase Order in the ERP solution isnâ€™t necessarily in the same vendor account as the one invoicing.
-	Type: Selects whether the template should be used as a Purchase Invoice or Statement, this will change the [Template Fields](./fields.md) available.
-	Existing Template: Allows for the selection of a previously created template within the current vendor to either modify or use as a base for a new template.
-	Document: Allows for the selection of a different document previously scanned with the selected template for comparison and easier template modification.
