Multi-page bounds enables the template to use a different area to select document details on the first page of a document to subsequent pages, this can be used for cases where the first page may contain a large header and any additional pages do not.

To enable the Multi-page Bounds option there must be at least two pages on the document. Selecting the second or any subsequent pages will allow enabling of the option, at which point all Multi-page compatible fields with current selections will be hidden, allowing for the selection of an additional area.

!!! info
	Once a field has a second selection area, if the Multi-page bounds option is deselected only the first page will display the area. To return to seeing it on all pages first delete the selection & then disable the option.
