The document viewer functions the same as in the [Document View](../document-view/document-viewer.md). Some additional options and functionality is available in the template editor however.

When a field is open for editing clicking & dragging on the document viewer will create a selection box, this is used to select the areas on the document the various fields should gathered from. For more information see [Template Editor - Fields](./fields.md).
Additional options are available in the 3 dots menu at the top right.

-	Highlight all Detected Text: Places a box around every word that has been detected on the document, hovering over these boxes will display the text that Invoice Automation believes is below it. NOTE: No automated processing system such as Invoice Automation gets detection correct 100% of the time, occasionally you may find that some characters or words have been misread.
-	Show Original Document: If this document has been split from a larger PDF incorrectly this will load the entire PDF into the editor to allow correction of the template.
