* Windows Installer

## Installation steps

1. Run the ApteanPrintAgentSetup exe file.

2. The setup opens a welcome page, Click **Next**.

3. Select a folder path for Aptean Print Agent to be installed. (Go with default);

4. Enter the `accountId` and `agentKey` for the respective environment and validate. Remember to use the key starting with **AGT** for Agent Key. (For the credentials, contact the Aptean representative.)

    1. If no credentials are entered and it tries to validate, it will prompt a pop up to enter credentials or to skip.

    2. Upon validation, if the Validation is success, click **Next** and move forward.

    3. If validation fails, it prompts whether to continue with wrong credentials. If okay with it, User must change the keys after the installation in the application.yaml file. Click **OK** to proceed.

> [!Note] If no credentials entered and it tries to skip step-4 by clicking **NEXT**. It will prompt to update keys after the installation in the application.yaml file. Click **OK** to proceed.

5. For Service, log on as Local System and go with default. Click **Next**.

    1. To connect to network printers, Choose Network service and enter the credentials. Click **Next**.

      > [!Note] (You must have privileges (**Admin Privileges**) to run services. If not, the service is disabled to start).

    2. If the entered credentials are correct, itâ€™ll prompt a pop-up with log on successful message. Click **OK**.

6. This step is for **existing user only**, where a choice is given to install freshly or to go with the existed configuration file i.e., application.yaml file (If Upgrade is chosen and new keys are entered during this installation, they are only replaced in the existed configuration file).

7. Click **Install** and **Finish**.

8. The Agent is installed as a Windows Service and should start up automatically.

## Service Logon

This helps to configure the system default printers and the network printers. The following steps describes the local setup logon post the installation:

1. Open Services and select **Aptean Print Agent**.

2. Right click on **Aptean Print Agent**.

3. Choose properties and move to Log on.

4. Select Log on as to this account and give credentials.

5. Click **OK**.

> [!Note] After applying Service Log on credentials, Do a restart of services.

## Agent Configuration 

The print agent configuration file is called `application.yaml`, located in the installation directory, by default:

   C:\Program Files (x86)\ApteanPrintAgent\application.yaml

It uses YAML syntax. Agent options are children of the top-level `printagent` property. Other configuration properties supported by Spring Boot may be specified as well, such as to change logging levels.
The accountId and agentKey can be set and validated during the installation setup process. These input keys are directly updated in the `application.yaml` file.

Example:

```yaml
printagent:
  accountId: 4c77b575ce594e6f904fbc95545f70cd
  agentKey: AGTd042c0e65c6a453a94fe41bde3e0b53a
  allowupdate: true
  priority: 1
  computerName: MyPrintServer
  tags: ["Chicago", "Reports"]
  printer-name-exclude: printer1,printer2

logging:
  level:
    com.aptean: TRACE
```

> [!Note] To fetch the printer name, follow these steps:
> 1. Navigate to **Settings**.
> 2. Choose **Printers & Scanners**.
> 3. Select the desired printer.
> 4. Click **Hardware Properties**.
> 5. The printer name will be shown.

## Verify Agent Connection

You should now see the agent associated with your account via the REST API.

You can execute the ``GET /print/agents`` operation via the Swagger Documentation or simply hit the URL directly in your browser:

**https://print.api.apteancloud.com/api/v1/print/agents**

This operation requires Basic HTTP authentication.  Your `accountId` is the username and `apiKey` is the password.

## Get list of printers for a Agent

With the agent connected, listing available printers, printer specific supported attributes and printer status can be got using the `GET /print/printers` REST API.
Attributes like print, orientation & paper-size lists multiple options supported by the respective printer. Attributes like copies, page-ranges are attributes which will help user print number of copies and page range as the names suggests. Finally attributes like media-printable-area and printer-resolution allows the user to print using margin controls and with specific resolutions in DPI. 

No request parameters needed.

## Refresh printers cache

With the agent connected, if new printers are available and/or printer status is changed we can refresh using the `POST /print/refresh` REST API.

No request parameters needed. 

### Example Response

```json
{
  "resultCode": 200,
  "errorMessage": "Success",
  "errorMessageKey": "",
  "errorDetailed": ""
}
```

## Upgrade an Agent

With the agent connected, an agent can be self-updated to the latest version and restart itself using the `GET/print/agents/upgrade` operation on the REST API.

## Example Request

 Specify  
`computerName`: "MyComputerName"

## Example Response

```json
{
  "resultCode": 200,
  "errorMessage": "Success",
  "errorMessageKey": "",
  "errorDetailed": ""
}
```

## Upgrade all Agents

With the agents connected, a silent upgrade takes place. All are self-updated to the latest version and restart themselves using the `GET/print/agents/upgradeAll` operation on the REST API.
Only the connected agents are upgraded to latest version and the not connected ones should be upgraded on the need once connected to server.

No request parameters needed.

## Example Response

```json
{
  "resultCode": 200,
  "errorMessage": "Success",
  "errorMessageKey": "",
  "errorDetailed": ""
}
```

## Delete an Agent

An agent can be deleted using the operation `DELETE/print/agents/{computerName}` on the REST API.

### Example Request

 Specify  
`` computerName ``: "MyComputerName"

### Example Response
```json
{
  "resultCode": 200,
  "errorMessage": "Success",
  "errorMessageKey": "",
  "errorDetailed": ""
}
```
 To get this deleted agent to be reflected in the printers list, need to run the `POST/print/agents/refresh` REST API.

## Restart an Agent

With the agent connected, an agent can be restared using the `GET/print/agents/restart` operation on the REST API.

### Example Request
 Specify  
`` computerName ``: "MyComputerName"

### Example Response

```json
{
  "resultCode": 200,
  "errorMessage": "Success",
  "errorMessageKey": "",
  "errorDetailed": ""
}
```

## Command Configuration

The Print Agent can be configured to expose virtual printers that invoke local programs or simply copy a file to local directory, thereby supporting label printing software such as Bartender and Loftware.

Commands are invoked using the same REST API used to print to real printers. From the point of view of the product queueing a print job, there is no difference, except that a Command does not require a file (base64 content or URL).

## Configuration

The print agent configuration file is called `application.yaml`, located in the installation directory, by default:

   C:\Program Files (x86)\ApteanPrintAgent\application.yaml

Multiple commands can be configured using YAML array syntax, as follows:

```yaml
printagent:
  # ... other settings ...
  commands:
    - name: Virtual Printer 1
      command: c:\bin\printer1.exe 
      working-dir: c:\tmp 
      arguments: ["$(FILENAME)"]
    - name: Virtual Printer 2
      drop-dir: c:\tmp
```

## Properties

The following table describes the available child properties of printagent.commands:

| Property             | Description                                          |
|--------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------|
| `name`             | Name of the virtual printer to explore to API users. |
| `working-dir`      | The working directory to use when executing the command. See Working Directory.|
| `command`          | The command to execute. |
| `arguments`        | The arguments to pass to the command, after variable substitution. |
| `drop-dir`         | The local directory to write the file provided with the print job, if any.  If this is not specified, the agent will attempt to use a temporary location specified by the OS. |
| `capture-output`   | If set to true, any output from the command (both standard output and standard error) are captured and stored with job status.  Default is false. |
| `delete-file`      | If `true`, the local file will be deleted after the command completes.  |
| `allowed-env-vars` | List of variables from the request to set as environment variables before executing. |
|

## Arguments and Variables

The `arguments` property must be specified as an array of strings.  Each string will be passed as an individual argument to the command, even if it contains spaces.  Spaces within argument values will not act as argument delimiters.  For example, this will not likely work as expected:

```
   arguments: [ "--file $(FILENAME)" ]
```

It will be passed as a single argument.  Instead, do this:

```
   arguments: [ "--file", "$(FILENAME)" ]
```

Variable references in arguments are of the format `$(VARNAME)`, where `VARNAME` is the name of a variable given in the `vars` array of a print job, or a built-in variable.

If a variable with the name provided is not found, the string will not be replaced.  

### Built-in Variables

`FILENAME` is the only built-in variable.  It is set to the filename of the drop file.  If no file was given, it will not be set. 

If `FILENAME` was also given in the `vars` array of a print job, it will act as a fallback value if no file given.

### Environment Variables

Variables provided with the print job request that are listed in `allowed-env-vars` will be set as environment variables before executing the command.

## Working Directory

When a command is executed which uses relative paths to access the filesystem, the command uses the working directory defined when the process was started to determine the full path.

The working directory used when executing a command is determined as follows:

* If specified, the `working-dir` property of the command configuration is used. It is recommended that this be explicitly defined for each command.

* If `working-dir` is not specified, the default OS temporary directory is used.  This is usually read from the TEMP environment variable on Windows, and set to /tmp on Unix and Linux.  This can also be set globally for the Agent using the `java.io.tmpdir` system property.

* If the default OS temporary directory cannot be determined, the installation directory of the Aptean Print Agent is used (which is not desirable)

### Examples

### Transfer File and Execute Command

This example will write a file to the local filesystem then execute a command.

```yaml
  commands:
    - name: LabelsFromCSV
      command: c:\bin\printer.exe 
      working-dir: c:\tmp
      arguments: [ "-template", "label.tpl", "-csv", "$(FILENAME)" ]
      drop-dir: c:\tmp
      delete-file: true
```

Example `POST /jobs` request:

```json
{
  "base64content": "ZXhhbXBsZSxjc3YsZmlsZQ==",
  "computerName": "SERVER-000001",
  "filename": "job432.csv",
  "printerName": "LabelsFromCSV"
}
```

## Execute Command without File

This example executes a command without transferring a file.

```yaml
  commands:
    - name: BarcodePrinter32
      command: c:\bin\printer.exe 
      working-dir: c:\tmp
      arguments: [ "-template", "barcode128.tmpl", "-code", "$(BARCODE)" ]
```

Example ``POST /jobs`` request:

```json
{
  "computerName": "SERVER-000001",
  "printerName": "BarcodePrinter32",
  "vars": [
     {
        "name": "BARCODE",
        "value": "RI 476 394 652 CH"
     }
   ]
}
```

## Drop File Only

This example simply writes a file to the local filesystem and completes.

Agent configuration:

```yaml
  commands:
    - name: Drop File Example
      drop-dir: c:\tmp
```

Example `POST /jobs` request:

```json
{
  "base64content": "ZXhhbXBsZSxjc3YsZmlsZQ==",
  "computerName": "SERVER-000001",
  "filename": "job432.csv",
  "printerName": "Drop File Example"
}
```
