Search for articles using keywords in the **Article Title**, **Article Number**, **Article Description**, or **Article Detailed Description**.  

The * wildcard can be used for partial matches such as docu* or *docu.
Expand the **Search Criteria** and use additional filter options, such as Type, Product, and more. You can also select specific fields to refine the search criteria.
