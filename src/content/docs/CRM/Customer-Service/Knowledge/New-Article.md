There are multiple ways to create a new article.
* From **Knowledge Library** Navigation Menu > **New Article**.
* From **Customer Service** > **Knowledge** > **Search**, or **Knowledge Library** > **Search**, click the (+) icon to create a new article. 
* From a **Case** record > **Options** > **New Article**. This option copies information from the case, and the newly created article will be auto linked to the selected case.

It is the best practice to link an article to a Category for better track. 

Taking a frequently asked question as an example, you can enter subject to the **Title** field, and enter question to the **Description** field. Upon saving, you can then add more details of the answer in the **Article tab** or attach files with more detailed explanations.
