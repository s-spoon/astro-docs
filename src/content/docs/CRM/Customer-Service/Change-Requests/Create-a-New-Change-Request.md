There are several methods to create a new change request:
* From the Customer Service Navigation menu, select **New** > **Change Request**.
* From the Change Requests quick search, click the (+) icon.
* From the main view of a Case record, choose **Options** > **New Change**. This method copies details such as product, part and notes from the case into the newly created Change Request.
