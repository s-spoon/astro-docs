There are several methods available to create a new case:

* The case is reported by the contact through the Portal. Please refer to the Portal for further details. 

* From the Customer Service Navigation menu, **New** > **Case**.

* From the Cases quick search, click **New Customer Case** (the (+) icon).

* From the main view of a Contact record, **More** > **Cases** > **New Case**. This method automatically populates the company and contact information.

The New Case card provides basic information for the user to enter quickly. By default, only the **Description** field is required. For better tracking of the reported issue, you may also enter additional relevant fields such as Product, Version, Request Type, Priority, and others. Use the Notes section to provide a detailed description of the issue. Attachments can be added if necessary. You can also assign the case to the Support team member and specify the Queue.
