Add activities to a case to document any customer interactions, such as conference calls, emails, portal messages, and more. 

For example, add a portal message activity to the case, asking the customer for more information. To do this: 

1.	Open a case and go to **Recent Activities** > **Options** > **New**. 

    Add an activity from the **History** or **To Doâ€™s** tab. When adding an activity from the **Case** page, it is automatically linked to the case. 
    Use the **Activity** quick search, and click **New Activity** (the (+) icon). Ensure to manually link the case in Participants groupbox. 
2.	Choose the **Action**, such as **Message**. 
3.	The contact, company and the related case information is automatically populated in **Participants** groubox. 
4.	Enter the update in **Notes** groupbox. 
5.	Expand the **Other** groupbox, and enable the **Published to portal** checkbox to display the message on the portal for the customer. 
6.	Update the case status as needed, such as **More information Required**. 
The contact can also post an update from Portal, which will appear as an activity under the **History** tab. For more details, refer to the [Customer Portal](Customer-Service/Customer-Portal/contents.md).
