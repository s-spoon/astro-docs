Users can run a case search with specific criteria, and save it for future usage. Start your daily work by executing these searches. 

For example: 

* Run a case search by **Queue** and **Status**, to retrieve a list of all open cases in your own queue. 
* Run a case search by **User** and **Status**, to retrieve a list of all open cases assigned to you. 

Switch the grid layout to display more fields. User can also add more fields to the grid to create a more meaningful list.
