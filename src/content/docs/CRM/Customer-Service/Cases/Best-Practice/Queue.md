Queues are used to distribute and assign cases to groups of qualified representatives. 

Set up multiple queues in **Setup** > **Codes** > **Customer Service**, and assign a group of representatives in each queue.

Divide cases into different queues based on criteria, for example Company, Product, Type and more. Then the representatives in each queue can focus on their own area respectively.
