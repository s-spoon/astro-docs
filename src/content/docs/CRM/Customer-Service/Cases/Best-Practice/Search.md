When dealing with a case, there are a couple of ways to search for resolution. 

* Run a case search to check for any similar cases reported previously. Use **Description** and **Notes** as the search criteria. 
* Go to **Options** > **Similar Cases**, **Search for Articles**, **Similar Change Request**. These options allow you to search for cases, articles, or change requests using the case title and Product as keywords.
