The CRM customer portal can be set up in **Setup** > **Portal** > **Portal Setup**.

The server address should include the same address you use to connect to Aptean CRM through the browser, followed by **/portal** and the **profile** at the end.
 
For example, if your regular CRM URL is https://mycompany.apteancrm.com, and you are using the profile crm1010, the Portal URL should be: https://mycompany.apteancrm.com/portal?profile=crm1010
