The Daily Planner is the default screen that appears when you log into CRM and displays the key information required for the user.
* Keep track of activities using badges & dashboard panels
* Click the data of the panels to know more information
* Filter panel results
* Review your schedule for the current day
* Organize your To Do list containing open activities assigned to you
* Perform Global Search along with entity specific searching
* Create New entities, for example: Activity, based on your role based user group login
* Alerts based on your role based user group login

The Daily Planner screen includes badges and panels which can added, hidden, or removed. 

The following predefined badges and panels will be displayed by default  irrespective of the user login. The further addition of badges or panels depends on role based user login.
* **My Past Due Activities** (Badge)
* **My Open Activities Today** (Badge)
* **My Activities Completed Today** (Badge)
* **My Contacts** (Badge)
* **Today's Schedule** (Dashboard List)
* **To Do's** (Dashboard List)

## To Do’s List and Today’s Schedule 
The **To Do’s** list displays all open activities assigned to you that should be completed, while **Today’s Schedule** list focus on the activities with a **Start Date** of Today.

Click **New Activity** in **Today’s Schedule**, or Click **To Do List** > **Options** ＞**New Activity** to create a new activity. You can **Filter** the data by selecting the appropriate activity under **Action** dropdown, or by using the **Field Picker** to filter by fields.
You also have option to filter the data between specific period by entering **Start Date From** and **Start Date To** fields.

**Managing Activities** 
* Selection of any activity opens a Card with all the information related to the specific activity. 
* Use the Notes area to keep track of your work with any pertinent information.
* In Attachments groupbox, click Add(+) icon to attach documents related to the activity. The attachment appears as an icon with the given filename. You can click the icon to open, delete, or send it as an email. 
* To close an activity, choose an option from the Result field, for example: Completed, Canceled and more. The Result code varies from action to action. This deletes the activity from the To Do’s list and Today’s schedule. The goal is to have an empty To Do list by the end of each day.

Activities with scheduled timeline, such as appointments, appearing in both **To Do’s** list and **Calendar** panels helps to track the completion time. If the Start Date/Time and End Date/Time are identical, the activity will only appear in your **To Do's** list because the time the activity occurs is unimportant
