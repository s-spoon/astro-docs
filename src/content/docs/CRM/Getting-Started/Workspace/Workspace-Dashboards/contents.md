To open any Dashboard such as **Calendar**, **Daily Planner**, **Customer Service**, or **Sales** , select the specific dashboard in the left side navigation menu..

Add additional panels to a dashboard from **Options** > **Select Panels**. Refer [Working with Dashboard Badges and Panels](../contents.md), for more details.

The dashboard automatically remembers and displays the additional panels you select. To restore the default panels to the dashboard, click **Options** > **Restore Defaults**.

Click the individual panel to drill down for more details. To get details about any segmented piece of a graph/chart click the respective part. Each panel can be refreshed, and results can be filtered.
