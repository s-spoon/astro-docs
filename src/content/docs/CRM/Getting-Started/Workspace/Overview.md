The **Workspace** module is the organizational area of the software that incorporate common functions including **Searches**, **Dashboards**, **Badges**, **Recents**, **Favorites** and **To Do's** list.

The Workspace area enables you to access contacts, companies, activities, cases, change requests and opportunities. These entities are opened as tabs with the provision to view, edit and browse.

**Daily Planner** is the default page providing a snapshot of important data according to the Userâ€™s role.

The **Global Search** feature found on the top center, searches for records by relevance. The other advanced method is to search the records from the specific entity (Contacts, Companies, Activities, Cases, Opportunities, or Change Requests).  The search results are displayed in the grid view. Refer [Searches](../contents.md), for more details.

**New** contains options to create items that are frequently added, such as contacts, companies, cases, opportunities and business card. New pages contain only the most used and required columns. This makes the data entry quicker and simpler.

**Dashboards** display the graphical view of recorded data, helping the user to have quick and easy observation. Each dashboard comprises a series of panels and panels consolidate data to represent it in visual form. Panels such as charts, badges and lists can be changed, sized and rearranged. 

The **Recents** display the recently opened items and **Favorites** display a list of records you opened more frequently.
