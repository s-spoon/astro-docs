If you can't find the records, you're looking for using a customized search, try filtering your search results to narrow down. You can filter the search results from your Customized search or in tandem with your advanced search criteria.

1.	Click the **Filter** icon found in the header area. This opens the **Search Filters** drawer. 
2.	Click **Options** > **Add Filter**.  The **Field Picker** displays limited field names related to the record type (Contacts, Companies, Activities, Cases, Opportunities or Change Requests). To view all the fields available associated to the entity, select **Options – Show All**. To see ALL database fields select **Options – Show All** to display all fields.
3.	Select the filtering fields by clicking on the field name. The field expression will display on the **Edit Filter** card. Fill in the **operator** and **value**. 
4.	Click accept ![](/Modules/assets/Images/008.png) to apply the change.
5.	Click **Options** > **Add Filter** to add additional field expressions. After selecting two or more field expressions, you can build complex queries by changing the operator from **And** to **Or** to specify exactly what you’re searching for while also ruling out what you don’t want to show up. 
Use **AND** to search for records with at least one occurrence of EACH condition.
Use **OR** to search for records with at least one occurrence of ANY condition


    > [!Tip] **Example of AND condition with results:** <br>Find all companies that start with "A" AND has an annual sales greater than or $1000.00.
Example of OR condition with results: Find all companies that start with "A" OR has an annual sales greater than or $1000.00.

     
6.	On selection of each filter, you can edit the expression to, whether it’s equal to, greater than, empty, or other custom quantifications. These also contain dates or times to search for activities, companies, or other items created after, before, or between specific dates or time. To select a date or time, click the calendar or time icon next to field value to open a small calendar or clock.
7.	In the **Search Filters** drawer you can **Group** different search criteria together to make better use of the operators. 
Select two or more filters, click the **Group** icon. **Ungroup** filters will separate criteria to create another level of your search. Move filtered criteria up and down to create proper grouping.
To delete the selected filters, click **Delete**. 


    > [!Note] Grouped filters are deleted as a group. 



8.	Once you have the criteria and filtering set-up for your customized search, click accept ![](/Modules/assets/Images/008.png)  to apply the filters and groups. When filters have been applied to a search the **Filter** icon turns green.
9.	Save the search under the corresponding record type as seen in [Saving a Customized Search](../Customized-Search/Saving-a-Customized-Search.md) above.
