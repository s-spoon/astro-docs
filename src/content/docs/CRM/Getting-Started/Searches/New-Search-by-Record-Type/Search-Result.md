Search results are displayed in the default tile view below the search criteria. Record counts are displayed on the toolbar line above the tile view.


>[!Tip] For example, 0 of 100 (+) means there are 100 records on one page, the + indicates there are more records. Click + to view the total number of records. Assume the example shows 0 of 100(399), then there are 399 result records with 100 per page.


Based on the type of layout(tile/grid) selection, the results toolbar allows: 
* **Add** new records
* **Switch Layout** (Tile or Grid)
        
    Tile view only displays 3 lines of text.
* Start a **Workflow**

    The Workflow allows you to perform mass function, for example: assign a bunch of contacts to a new Rep.

    From the grid view, you can **Export to Excel** your search results. In the search results, select the records you want to export by using the check boxes on the left or the **Select All** check box.
