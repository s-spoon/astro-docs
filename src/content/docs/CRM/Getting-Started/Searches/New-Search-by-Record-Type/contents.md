Unlike the Global Search, which quickly search through multiple record types, Search by Record Type limits the search within the exact record type.

The search feature is configured to search on a specific primary field for each record type.
* Contacts search by Last Name, First Name
* Companies search by Company Name
* Activities search by Description
* Cases search by Case #
* Opportunities search by Opportunity Description and then Company Name
* Change Requests search by Case #

You find two options to search through record types, either by a quick search or by building a customized advanced search.

Both the options allow you to further filter your search results using "and/or" statements. By default, a saved search is only available to the user who created it. Administrators have the ability to make a saved search public.
