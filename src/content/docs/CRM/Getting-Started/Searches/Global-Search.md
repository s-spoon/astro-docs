The **Global Search** is a dynamic search feature responding with related search results as you type. Using the global search, you can find a specific record from a large database containing numerous records. Enter the first 3 characters of the record, regardless of the record type, and you will find a list of all record results associated with the characters.

Each record is displayed as a tile view limited to 3 lines of information. You can click the specific record to get the detailed information in the card view.
Click the dropdown arrow of the Global Search field, you can select the exact record type(s) to search through, for example: Contact, Activity, Company, Opportunity and Customer Case. All those five record types are selected by default. You can toggle on or off the corresponding checkboxes and build your own global search criteria.
