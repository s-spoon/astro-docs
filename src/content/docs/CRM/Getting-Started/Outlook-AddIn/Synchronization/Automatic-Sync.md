Contacts and activities in Aptean CRM are designated to be synced. Go to each contact or activity record, click the **Options** > **Sync with Outlook**. Any contact and activity that has been successfully synced now has **End Sync with Outlook** displayed with a green cycle icon under **Options**.

When you export an item, it is automatically synced with Outlook every time you make a change. There is no longer a need to re-export an item after editing. To end the automatic syncing of an item, reselect the **Options** > **End Sync with Outlook**.

In the Outlook application, under **CRM Add-In** > **Options** >**Settings**, you can indicate folders you wish to automatically synchronize with Aptean CRM. Any item with a tag of OnContact in these folders is automatically processed. There is no need to re-export items from Outlook to Aptean CRM after changes are made.

When the Outlook Add-in synchronization runs, changes made to tagged items in either application are processed. In the cases changes were made to linked items in both applications, the changes made last are applied.

In case of any delays caused by network issue, you can manually click the Sync button in outlook **Home** ribbon bar > **Aptean CRM Add-in** > **Sync**.
