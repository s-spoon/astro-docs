* **Contact** - contains the **Add/Open CRM Contact** option. That will sync the contact to Aptean CRM. 

Any email, contact, appointment or task with a tag of On Contact indicates it has been synced to Aptean CRM. If you review the related contact or activity in Aptean CRM, it will be displayed as **End Sync with Outlook** with a green cycle icon under **Options**.
