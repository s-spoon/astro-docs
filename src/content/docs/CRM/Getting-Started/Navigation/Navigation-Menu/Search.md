**Global Search**

The Global Search is a dynamic search feature that responds with related search results as you type. The global search is the quickest way to search for all record types using a keyword method and ranking priority. Search results display each record as a tile view limited to 3 lines of information.

**Search by Record Type**

The Record Type Search section of the Navigation menu contains options for entering criteria before running a search. Click the **Search** icon to locate all records (contact, companies, activities, cases, opportunities or change requests) or perform filtered and advanced searches by record type.

**Save As Searches**

A Save As Search option contains refined search criteria saved for future reference and can be used repeatedly. Click the dropdown arrow next to the record type to display the recent searches. The search results display in the default tile view.

Refer [Searches](../contents.md), for more details

You can export the searched data as excel output by clicking the **Export to Excel** option. This option is viewed in Grid view. Click **Switch Layout** to change from default tile view to grid view.

You can perform any action on the searched data by selecting the **Workflow** options available in both tile/grid view.
