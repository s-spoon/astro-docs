The **New** section on the Navigation menu is where you can create records that are frequently added, such as contacts, companies, cases, opportunities and business cards. New pages contain only the most used and required columns so that data entry is quick and simple.
Duplicate checking is performed when adding new company and contact records. If possible duplicates are found, a prompt is displayed to confirm the addition of the new record.


> [!Note] When you create a new contact or company record, an entry in the zip code column automatically populates city, state, and country after filling the required fields marked in red.
