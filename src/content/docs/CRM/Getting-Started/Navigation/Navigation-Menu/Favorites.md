Similar to Recents, the **Favorites** section of the Navigation menu displays a list of records you would open more frequently. To skip the search process, you may place items in the Favorites list. 

Favorites can be added to this list by pressing the **Favorites** icon on any Edit page, for example company or contact. If the record has been added to Favorites, the **Favorites** icon turns green. 

To remove a record from Favorites, open the record type, click the **Favorites** icon again to remove the record from favorites.
