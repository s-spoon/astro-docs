## Best Practice 
Every time a sales rep makes a call, it's best practice to create an activity to log that call. This will ensure the record of every interaction with the contact and provide a clear picture of the sales progress from the beginning. It also keeps the track of your own activities, events and notes which could help in delegating the job to another person in your organization, if required.
