1.	**Initial Import of Sales History**  
ERP is the master record for sales history, and the integration is one-way. CRM displays the sales history but does not modify it. Therefore, the ERP system is responsible for loading the sales history for each contact and company into CRM.

2.	**Integrated Sales History**

    **AR Summary** – A summary of outstanding invoices for a company, passed from ERP to CRM. CRM does not generate this AR Summary from ERP invoices.

    **Orders** – Orders and order lines associated with a company.

    **Invoices** – Invoices and credit memos, including invoice lines, for a company.

    **RMAs** – Return Material Authorizations (RMAs) for a company.
