Aptean CRM requires a customer or tenant subscription through the ATG (Advanced Technical Group) subscription management service. 
The setup of this service creates a customer account with a tenant ID that includes the Aptean CRM subscription. 
The ERP system uses the tenant ID, APIM (Application Programming Interface Management) key, and tenant secret to authenticate calls to Aptean CRM.
