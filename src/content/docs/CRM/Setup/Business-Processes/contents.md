Business processes automate and guide procedures for your organization. A business process is a series of steps comprised of workflow actions that interact with your CRM data. Workflow may be used to select, create, remove, and update data. Each step has a collection of conditions to control the flow of targets through the process. Targets may be contacts, companies, opportunities, or cases. Business processes may be used to automate procedures such as email drip campaigns, lead nurturing, and opportunity sales methods.

Processes are defined and managed from **Setup** > **Business Processes** or **Marketing** > **Campaign**. Campaign is also one kind of business processes. 

Go to **Setup** > **Business Processes** and click Search. Here it lists all the business processes defined in Aptean CRM and grouped by the entity type, for example: Campaign, Contact, Opportunity, and more  . Select   each record to open and review the Business Process associated to it.  

A **Details** tab provides a high-level view of a process through a series of badges and charts. Here you may monitor progress and navigate to data related to process targets and steps. The following image shows   a business process defined for a lead qualification.
