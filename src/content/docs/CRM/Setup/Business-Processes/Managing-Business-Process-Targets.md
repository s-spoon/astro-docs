Targets may be assigned to business processes in several different ways. 
* They may be added with **Workflow** options found on entity list pages. 
For example, from Contact List, select one or more contacts and click **Workflow** > **Assign** > **Assign Business Process Target** to assign contact(s) to contact related business processes. 
* They may also be assigned from the **Targets** tab of the **Business Process** view.

Business process data may be viewed from a target recordâ€™s view page.

For example, the **Business Process** tab on the **Opportunities** page shows all processes an opportunity is assigned to, including active and completed. From this tab you can track the status of a target as they move through processes. Notes are available to help guide users through tasks and step goals.

By clicking the **Activity**(clock) icon of each step, you can also work through activities assigned by a process step. You can view the completed and pending tasks.
