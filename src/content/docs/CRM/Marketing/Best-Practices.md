## Targeting Your Customer Using Interest, List, and Source 
The following fields can be used to target your customers for more effective Marketing. Each of these are searchable, and you can assign multiple values for each.

**Interest – Located on Company, Contact, and Opportunity records** 
* Used to indicate the set of your products and services they are interested in.
* Located on the Profile tab.

Use the **Interest** field to keep track of which products and services contacts are interested in. It is easy to send them quick marketing messages, emails or other communications when something new occurred to the product.

You can also add an interest subgroup to further qualify what a particular customer is interested in. For example, your primary group could be Services, and the subgroup Repair Services.

Then quickly search for contacts based on their interest, email them, create an Activity, and more.

**List – Located on Company and Contact records** 
* Used to categorize groups of records, For example:  Holiday mailing list, or Distributor, Tier 1 Customer,
* Located on the Profile tab.

**Source - Located on Company, Contact, Opportunity records** 
* Another way to categorize records, typically for Marketing and can be linked to Leads.
* Located on the Profile tab.
    >[!Note] Interest / List / Source codes can be defined in Setup > Codes > Campaign & Marketing.
