You can define various steps for your Campaign to automate many different functions. For example, you may want to have the system automatically send an email alert to your Sales Rep when a target completes the Contact Us page on your website. Or, you may want to automatically remove a target from your Campaign if they opt out of your email.
You can define a wide variety of scenarios to ensure that your Campaigns runs smoothly and efficiently.

To access this select the **STEPS** tab from the Campaign record.

**Conditions and Actions**

Each step has a condition, which defines when the step will happen via either a time offset value, an event â€“ or both. When the condition and/or time offset has occurred, the Action(s) you define will take place.

This is the set of Conditions and Actions provided for you to choose from:

>[!Tip] The Days offset is the number of days since the previous step occurred- so first step is usually set to blank or zero.

>[!Note] One campaign can have multiple steps. In most cases, one Step will have only one action defined for it.
