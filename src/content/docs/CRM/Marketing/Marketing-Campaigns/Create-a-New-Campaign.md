When adding a new campaign there are a couple of methods:

* On the left navigation pane, select **Marketing** > **New** > **Campaign**.
* From the Campaign quick search, click **New Campaign** (+) icon.

The add new campaign card has several groupboxes of information but by default only **Description** is the required field. Enter other fields such as **Status**, **Manager**, **Type**, **Start Date**  and **End Date** for better tracking. You can also specify the **Number of Targets**, **Estimated Cost** and **Estimated Revenue**.
