It’s important to set up your Company default information by following these steps:
1.	Select **Administration** > **Group Configurations**. 
2.	Click Search Icon.
3.	On the **Portal** FastTab, click **My Company Settings**.

This data is used by Aptean CRM for Social Media, Email icons for Email Templates and more. 

Once you have completed this data, there is no need to adjust the links in your email templates. Aptean CRM will automatically use the data shown here. 

For example, you have defined the Email Template to insert **My Company Fields** > **Company Name**. Then every time you update the Company Name under Group Configurations, any new emails going forward will use the new Company Name automatically.

## Your Company Logo

Save time and make your templates consistent by replacing the **company-logo.jpg** file in the web image library(**Marketing** > **Email Marketing** > **Web Images**) with your own company’s logo. 
Do not change the file name- keep it named company-logo.jpg. 
When you have done this, ALL templates that use this image will be updated to use your own logo!
