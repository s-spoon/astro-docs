The Marketing module allows you to perform the following key functions: 
* Create and manage Marketing campaigns
* Design and send email blasts, and track their results   
* Automate steps within any campaign
* Import suspect Lead   data from your website

A marketing campaign is a coordinated series of activities that can include promotion of a product through different mediums (television, radio, print, online) using different types of advertisements, communication, demonstrations, tradeshows or other interactive techniques.

Marketing campaigns can be designed with different goals in mind, including building a brand image, introducing a new product, increasing the sales   of the existing product on the market, or diminishing the negative    promotion

In addition, the Marketing module includes an Email Designer   so email campaigns can be incorporated easily into any marketing effort and tracked.

Suspect Lead management is also supported, so you can separate this data from the Workspace until you have confirmed a valid lead and convert to a Contact for a Sales Rep to follow up with.
