A Lead record is created in a variety of ways:
* Create manually.  
* Import from a file (Excel or CSV) using the Lead Import template.
* Automatically via a Website form created in Aptean CRM
 
    * When a visitor on your site submits information, such as Name, email address, and phone number, through a web form generated in Aptean CRM and inserted into your website, a Lead is created including the captured information.   Also, all prior visit information is related to the   created lead so you can view what web pages were visited and how often.
For more details, please refer to [Web Forms](../Marketing-Visitors/Web-Forms).
