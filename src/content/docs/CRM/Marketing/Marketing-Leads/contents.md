Lead records are designed for suspects or potential sales/customers. You may either have very little information about them, or you have very little confidence (yet.md) that they have an interest in your products or services. 

You can use Lead records to keep track of their information, website visits, and your notes, as you follow up to determine their validity.

Lead records are only viewed in the Marketing area of Aptean CRM. At any point, you can promote a Lead to a Contact record so it can be further pursued in the Workspace by your sales team.
