## Why Use CRM?
CRM software allows for better management pipelines so that your sales managers and their representatives can stay on top of prospective sales, leading to better success in landing those sales opportunities. CRM tracks your activities with each customer so that everyone in the team has knowledge to effectively handle their questions and concerns. You have a complete view of the customer on one screen that keeps you fully informed about every customer across your organization.

Continuous monitoring of sales process and key alerts on the tasks helps to ensure that the promising leads don’t go unnoticed. Built in reminders simplify the process of progressing communication with customers.

Customer Service is another major reason to implement CRM. Tracking cases, answering customer questions, responding effectively and proactively can be the key to providing outstanding service. Manage your marketing campaigns more effectively to generate leads, mine data, nurture prospects and turn them into customers.

## Entity Relationships
Entity relationships are used to enter and maintain information in Aptean CRM. Each represents a table (entity) in the database where the records are stored. You can maintain an unlimited number of records and related information for all entities.

### Company
Companies are customers, prospects, partners, competitors, or other businesses you want to keep information about. Company records store the business information such as address, type of business, territory, and more.

### Contact
Companies are linked to your individual contacts, the actual people with whom your business interacts, such as the purchasing agent, president or sales rep. You can link contacts not only to company records, but also to activities, opportunities and cases.

### Activity
Activities are used to record interactions with companies and contacts (for example, telephone calls and meetings), and to record tasks or events associated with opportunities and cases.

### Opportunity
In addition to these three types of records, some people use Opportunities which can be linked to Company or Contact records.
Opportunities identify the details for potential sales, helping you to plan and manage your sales process and monitor the effectiveness of strategies for closing deals.

### Lead
Lead records are used by your Marketing team to keep track of your suspects and prospects as they are working to qualify them for the Sales team.
