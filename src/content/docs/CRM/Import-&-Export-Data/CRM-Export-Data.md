You can export records to Excel from the grid view of Searching result.  

For example, we are going to export all companies in Illinois and Wisconsin. 

1. Search for the records you would like to export. In this example, go to **Company** search and enter the search criteria. Click Search.  

2. Click **Switch Layout** ![](/Modules/assets/Images/001-import-and-export.png). This will switch the searching result to the grid view.  

3. Select the record(s) you would like to export. Use **Options** > **Select All** if needed.  

4. Click **Export to Excel** ![](/Modules/assets/Images/002-import-and-export.png). Your records will then be exported into an Excel file with the data displayed in the searching result columns.  

5. If you would like to export more columns, go to **Options** > **Select Fields** to add more columns prior to clicking **Export to Excel**.
