1. In **Import Setup**, choose the template that best matches your data to open the template record. 

2. Click **Options > Create Sample Spreadsheet** to save the default sample file with the headings only.  

3. Open the sample file and add your data into the appropriate columns. 
If you are adding multiple Contacts for each Company, create a row for each contact and copy the company data into each row, as shown in the sample template data. 

4. Delete any columns that you do not plan to use. 

5. If you want to import data to a standard entity field, and it is not already included in the template, just add the column(s) to the right of the other data in the spreadsheet. These will be individually mapped during the import process.
